This is the first room of many in the Realm of Monster. Once things get 
rolling, a simple series of rooms will be installed which will force
new players to get used to the Monster commands in order to reach the 
actual world. For now however, we will be cheesey, and merely deposit
you in the Realm at a convenient location. 

[Please note: The cheesey shortcut has finally been circumvented. We
will keep the above description however, because we like it so much.]

You stand at the entrance to the vast sewer system located beneath the
City of Tai-Tastigon. Sprawling out in all directions, the sewers lay
like the web of a giant spider - or like the maze of some deranged minotaur.

The south wall of this chamber is long, and has been artificially 
flattened and smoothed. The rest of the chamber has been left in its
rough, natural state. The south wall is decorated with a crude, and
disturbing, mural.

The mural depicts stocky humanoid creatures laying waste to a human

A multitude of gigantic, dark hued stones are arranged in a circular 
pattern here. Concentric with this arrangement is one of smaller blue

with marble tiles.

This stunning display stands on a mound of solid ground rising out of
the surrounding swamp. A feeling of immense natural power pervades the
entire area.

Despite the waist deep muck you are now forced to wade through, the

@dig/tel Great Bog;room_17
#
@desc
More so here than in any other area of the swamp or forest, you feel 
as though you are in immediate peril. The mist and swamp gas swirl as
if to purposely confuse you. The strange voice of the wind seems to
speak to you of the unyielding embrace of death that waits for you at 
the abyss bottom of a hidden bog or sink hole. Your mind screams with
fear, and your limbs are reluctant to follow your commands, for fear of
making the tragic mis-step that can only lead to a suffocating doom.

@dig/tel Row of Megaliths;room_18

@desc
An ancient footpath runs from the clearing to the north, south to the
circle of stones. Astride the path are a series of giant megaliths placed
at evenly spaced intervals.

The megaliths are carved from single blocks of a dark stone. Reaching a
height of 15 feet, the impassionate faces carved onto the rock surfaces
stare down upon travellers with indifference.

@dig/tel Swampy Forest;room_19

@desc
The ground here is composed of a muddy slush thickly covered with old 
leaves. The forest is once again dense, and absent of all but the faintest
slivers of light creeping through the leafy canopy. With every step you
take you sink to your knees, and must struggle to free yourself from the
persistant grasp of the amorpheous earth.

apprehension.

Twisted cyprus trees rise up here, intertwining in a sinister display.
A seemingly continuous palisade of cyprus trees runs north to south,
complicating any attempted passage to the west.

The sounds of the forest can be heard here, but to the west are noises
of an unknown nature. You wonder if it would not be better to avoid 
the dark tangle of woods that lies west of here.

The grey lands before you contradict the promise of the sun gate...
they are grey and unwelcome. The eastern lands were once a thriving

are now hollow, lost souls breaking out from beneath the crust of the
rotton land.

Nothing stays dead here for long..

#
@dig/tel Entrance Hall;room_24
#
@desc
A vast chamber of ice surrounds you, encompassing you in a giant tomb
of cold darkness. The walls of the chamber tier inward towards the
ceiling, and appear to have been painstakingly carved by magical hands.

From somewhere far, far above, a thin beam of light enters this 
towering crevace, and is reflected and scattered from surface to 
surface. The ice absorbs the light somewhat, giving back a deep blue
hue that speaks of natural wonders un-beholden to Mankind.
#

#
@dig/tel Redwood Forest;room_25
#
@desc
Lurching up like a wooden mountain here are giant redwood trees. The
reddish trunks are of impressive circumference, and rise straight up to
an incredible height. Even the Great Oaks are dwarfed by these monsters,
though the redwoods do not exude the same aura.

The ground here is bare, for the most part. The giant trees are seperated 
by large distances, providing a relief from the claustrophobic confines 
of the inner forest.
#
@set here/record_id = 25
#
@dig/tel Great Redwood;room_26
#
@desc
A lone tree is immense proportions towers towards the sky here. Its
gigantic roots ripple beneath the ground like some predator fish
caught at the surface of a frozen lake. Its base is as wide around
as a tower, and its rough bark nearly as tough as stone.

Bits of leaves drift down from above like a faint snowfall, and even
though no other trees can grow so close to this monster, the forest
here is dark and forboding.

#
@set here/record_id = 26
#
@dig/tel Forest Crossroads;room_27

@desc
The trees thin out here, allowing a small clearing that shows signs of
traffic. Unlike most of the Great Forest, light streams down upon you 
here, and smaller brushes and foliage flourish.

Ancient stones of immense size can be seen to the south of here, while 
the steady sounds of a slow moving, but mighty, river can be heard to
the west.

Rising up in an exposed fashion, unsheltered from the protective forest,
is a group of grassy mounds. These are ancient barrow mounds, holding the
remains and treasures of personages long forgotten by all except the Druids.

The barrows are apparently roofed in wood and stone, and covered with earth.
The largest of the mounds exudes a feeling of extreme age, and has fallen
prey to the effects of erosion. Large blocks of solid stone are visible.
While you might be able to pry one loose, and venture into the blackness
of the ancient grave, your better judgement tells you that such actions
might be unwise.

In the dim light you can see the walls of the great hall of covered
in tapestries, now tattered and burned and difficult to read. What
you can see of the stories told therein are confusing, giving little
information as to whom the inhabitants of this place were. Or how they

@desc
You arrive at the tomb of Darkmage, the wizard.  An eerie silence hangs in
the air.  A light breeze sends an occassional chill through your body.  The
tomb itself is a large concrete structure, simply crafted in a Gothic style.
Stairs lead up to a huge set of double doors.  The doors themselves have no
handles.  
The cemetery road extends east and west from here, splitting around the
tomb itself.  There are small gates along the north and south edges of the
road, separating the tomb area from the cemetery proper.
All is silent.
*Very* silent.

by 4 exits that lead from the four walls on the points of the compass.

#

#
@dig/tel Gaping Pit of Doom;room_41
#
@desc
A sputtering torch provides thankful light at this point. The tunnel 
widens out, and you are faced with a large, black hole that seems to 
devour the tunnel, and drag it down into the hidden depths below. 

The dark pit facing you is rough edged, and probably not made by
humanoid hands. You should be able to make a descent.
#

#
@dig/tel Doom Pit Bottom;room_42
#
@desc
You stand at the bottom of a black pit. The skeletons of small animals
who have fallen into the pit and died can be seen scattered about. 

A small hole has been knocked in the eastern wall of the pit bottom. The
hole is large enough for you to crawl through comfortably, and could 
accomodate a larger creature as well.

#
@dig/tel Cave of Mangled Elf;room_43
#
@desc
Lying near the center of this cave is the body of a humanoid creature.
It is difficult to tell exactly what race it is from, as it has been 
horribly beaten and disfigured, not to mention partially decayed.

The still form has been manacled to an iron ring set in the floor of
the chamber. Bloody tracks on the floor show the body was dragged in
from the west and has not moved since being chained here. It is 
therefore likely that the body was chained here after death. Perhaps
this is a warning?
#
@set here/record_id = 43
#
@dig/tel Cave of Skinned Man;room_44
#
@desc
Carefully positioned in the center of the this cave are the remains of
a man. The body has been skinned skillfully, and has been laid in a spread
eagle position. A 'U' shaped iron bar has been pounded into the rock 
floor around the chest of the body, pinning the torso tightly to the floor.

It occurs to you that instead of being a warning, this might actually
be a marker laid for the benefit of those who might inhabit these
caves. You shudder to think of what kind of beings would leave a skinned
body as a path marker.
#

#
@dig/tel Cave of Eaten Dwarf;room_45
#
@desc
Another grisly marker has been left here. This time it is a Dwarf, whose
legs have been gnawed off. An iron spike has been driven directly 
through the body. It dawns on you that these means of restraint are 
likely employed to keep wild creatures from removing the path markers.

A very large lance has been driven lengthwise through the body of a wild

This cavern is very large, and is strewn with large rocks that have 
been slightly chiseled, and serve as chairs. Three deep fire pits, 
ringed with stones, are situated throughout the chamber. A large 
mammoth tusk and a rough iron bell are suspended from a wooden 
superstructure in the north end of the room. The bell has no clapper,
but is instead rung by swinging the tusk into it.

Near the bell are some stone steps which lead up to a throne carved into

A great gate, what was once a primary entrance into the city, lies

This is a stark demarcation. West lie dark wilds accompanied by the

Priests can be seen moving about the Temple. Occassionallythey venture
to the rear of the temple, which is barred to normal patrons.

You are in a region of low, rolling hills. Vegetation and grasses abound,

A wall of dark clouds lies low on the horizon to the south.

A grisly sight greets you here, where the tunnel widens slightly.
Human remains, obviously very old but surprisingly well preserved,
have been dragged into the center of the passage, where they are
feasted upon by a horde of malevolent rats. The rats hungrily

You stand in a tunnnel which has been roughly burrowed into the earth.
Loose dirt occasionally falls in clumps, and you are struck by a 
severe claustrophibic feeling, as if the fragile passage might 
collapse in on you at any time. 

It is unclear whether this place was used as a crude catacomb, or 
whether it was merely burrowed through a heavily used grave yard.
In any event, human and humanoid remains push through the walls 
of the tunnel at several levels. The bones are evidently very old,
but some of the remains have been preserved remarkably well.

Each rock has a unique glyph carved into its surface, which stands out 
in brilliant white to contrast with the red of the surface. It is

At the center of the juncture is a raised platform of stone upon which
sits a large bronze brazier. In the brazier burns a greenish flame that
is apparently unaffected by the winds. It is said that in times of trouble,
this flame will rise up into an inferno as a signal to the Gods who are
said to reside to the northwest of the Endless Forest. Upon seeing the
signal, the Gods will don their weapons and come to the aid of the Druids.

stone work that has been done around the cave mouth that leads into the
underground darkness. The cave mouth has been carved and worked to 
appear like a giant gaping mouth, resplendent with viscious fangs and teeth.

@desc
This room has been hollowed out of the earth. The stone steps leading 
up were clearly an afterthought. Some timbers serve to keep the ground
from rushing in and collapsing the room.

A large tree grows out of the earthen floor of this room, and extends 
upward into the rooms above. Many large roots are visible, and a 
particularly large one snakes its way across the floor into the
room to the east. You touch the trunk of the tree...and are oddly greeted
by a faint beating rhythm under the trunk.

You stand on the battlements of the Cliff-face Tower, which thrusts
itself out of the heart of the mountainside in order to peer down
upon the slopes and vale below.

The battlements are buffeted by a strong wind that invigorates you. 
Rising still further above the battlements is the thin turret of the

This is the southern end of the Tunnel of Daggers. The passageway has
been widened and given extra heigth to the point where a room, of sorts,
exists here. While this area is unlit, light spills over from a side
passageway that leads west.

In the faint illumination, you are greated by an impressive stone portal

You are now just inside the outer gateway of the Warlord's mountain
fortress. Unlike the Tunnel of Daggers, the corridor here has been
carved out of the rock with great precision and skill. The wall and
floor surfaces are smooth.

South of here lies the first hall of the stronghold. Passage south,
however, can be effectively blocked through the use of the portcullis
that has been installed here. Fortunately, the portcullis is currently
raised, allowing you to slip into the stronghold with only stooping 
slightly, should you wish.

This cavernous hall existed long before this stronghold was ever built,
though the builders remain unknown. The room is very large in size, but
its occupants are even more impressive.

At first glance, you are greeted by a bristling army of soldiers and
lances. On closer examination you realize that the soldiers are actually
terra cotta statues. Rank upon rank they lie, arranged in companies and
echelons, 1000 in all. Legends say that these soldiers were once real men,
and will return to animated life yet again.

This hall is relatively small, but has a certain stately air about it.
It is here that recognition is payed to the sporadic Kings that have
been associated with the Warriors and their Lord throughout the ages.

High on the walls of this room, are icons depicting 10 previous Kings.
No attempt has been made to indicate the name appropriate to each

You now stand at the central landing of a truly impressive stairway.
Very wide steps accompanied by stone railings arch out of sight both
above and below this point. The general darkness of this area enhances
the spidery appearance of the stairway as it reaches out, seemingly 
without support, into the dark void of some central cavern. You can peer

You stand in a narrow concourse bedecked with arches and buttresses. The
ceiling is very high, and the intricate nature of the architecture lends
itself to more stately purposes, akin to that of a chapel. The flagstones
that floor the walkway of the concourse are "x's" that fit together

This room is square, but has a domed roof. Small cords hang down from

It depicts a group of warriors defending a tattered banner against a

around the well.

Peering down the well, you can see only blackness. You can hear the
sounds of sloshing water below, but it is fairly deep. A small winch

You notice, however, a small rubbish pile in the shadow of a house
that has some possibilities..

When you dig through the pile you find old axes and hatchets, probably
to be shipped to the forest land but abandoned now. Iron bars from
which the artisans make their intricate lamps, lie in a pile unnoticed.
An enterprising man might make due with one of these as a weapon.

This passage is very narrow, and very tall. There is barely enough room
for one armored man to walk down the passage, but the ceiling risis
some additional twenty feet above your head.

Adorning the walls that stretch above your grasp are various pennants

This room is large and rectangular in shape. The wall surfaces are 
covered with thick woven tapestries which depict past feats of arms
and courage.

Most of the tapestries tell the story of large battles and campaigns
which are now long forgotten by most. The identity of the individuals
depicted is unclear. The "who's" and "why's" of the particular conflicts
shown, however, is unimportant. What is important, is that sword and
sinew met against like, and yet another test of warriors' mettle was
passed.

This room is the terminus of what life holds in store for the man who
chooses the way of arms: battle, glory, and death. This room honors
the glory achieved by those of the past. The moment of victory, of 
timultuous triumph and painful loss, is honored here. Fame and glory
is fleeting, but this chamber pays tribute to all the success of arms,
to the instant when victory is fresh, and the dead are still warm 
upon the field of battle.

The room is walled in marble, and the hundreds of small niches carved

Several smiths are busily working here at any given time. You notice that
many of them seem to be dwarves. They are totally enraptured in their work,

This is the base of the seemingly impossible tower that rises above. The
tower has a slim base, but buttresses and wings that extend into space 
with no apparent support. From the outside of the building, you can see
domes and minarets rising out of spidery wings that extend out in 
right angles. Common sense would dictate that a strong breeze would 
topple this unlikely place, and yet it stands firm without a hint of
sway.

The base is open to the outside, with four slim pillars existing as the
sole foundation for all that towers above.

The surface of the silver is smooth and without any visible marks, with

Huge blocks of iron are stacked in this room. The walls here are of stone

Traveling through the room, you find yourself swaying involuntary, as if
you have lost full control of your limbs. It dawns on you that this might

This room lies in stark contrast with most of the other rooms in this

The stone seems to consciously devour all light, and pulsate with the
digested energy. A candle burns here, but its illumination seems 
hollow and insignificant.

Wide, low steps of the same black stone lead both up and down in front

Steep, narrow steps lead further up into this improbable structure

You stand on a spiraling nightmare of utter blackness and despair. A pallid
light shines from below, but it is devoured without shedding its warmth or
hospitality. 

The steps are wide and low, though it is very difficult to distinguish
them in the darkness. As you walk the steps, you are greeted by silence. 
Even an echo would be welcome. Instead, the dark stone devours the sound
of your passage almost as soon as it is issued. You put your hand to the
smooth stone, but cannot determine is the pulsating sensation you feel is
from the stone or your own pounding heart.

stare at the scene before you. What can only be described as a demon
is restrained in some sort of magical cage in this chamber. A man in
a heavy cloak stands before the cage, making frantic hand gestures,
accompanied by some non-sensical mumbling. 

Suddenly, the magical cage is burst asunder, and the demon, holding a

to tiers of ice that hang like glamorous balconies over the floor
below. A strange, chilling mist rises of the perfectly flat ice 
floor of the room. It swirls a bit before dissipating only a few
feet from the surface.

Far into the ice above, intricate figurines can be seen. The nature
of the carvings is not clearly visible from here, however.

The roof of this chamber is lower than that to the south, and from it
hang a solid cluster of icicles. The icicles are of great size, 
stretching from the ceiling some fifteen feet above down to the floor.

Passage through this room is difficult as you have to pick your way
through the inversely tapering columns of ice that block your path.

Light filters in from above somewhere, and fills the room with a dull
light amplified by the white iciness of the structures within it.

this chamber to further hidden places. At first you discard this 
place as nothing more than an uninteresting nuisance. Then you notice 
the objects and other signs of habitation. Then the footprints.

this place was once the home of the great Guilds of the Realm.

This chamber appears rather spacious and exotic. For some reason, the

left this room untouched. Though abandoned, it looks as if this room 
was only left a few days ago by its occupant. The thought slowly

rises from the center of the room, and is capped with a natural basin.

In the basin is a pool of liquid which burns with a nearly transparent

their valuable contents have all disappeared. From the disarray apparent
here, whomever removed the valuables likely did so in a hurry.

@dig/tel Dead Branch;room_336

@desc
As you step onto the wide branch, it gives way underneath your weight.
For a split second you are in free-fall until the branch catches, and bends,
upon a lower tree. The wood of the branch is dead and rotted, and 
compresses with surprising ease under the wieght of your footsteps.

A small vine serves as a railing here, but if it is in the same condition
as this branch, you would be well advised not to trust your life to it.

@dig/tel Shaken Platform;room_337
#
@desc
This is a wide platform constructed of timbers lashed together. The 
weakness of the dead trees on which the platform rests causes it to
pitch wildly as you step onto it. It repeats this motion as you shift
your wieght and move around.

It is on raised platforms like these that much of the now gone 
populace lived on. The fallen remains of other platforms can be seen
from this vantage point through the hazy light present here in this
huge cavern. A lashing of tree branches forms a roof above you, while
a main trunk continues up through the roof.

Large trees from the dead forest surrounding the structure have come
crashing through this area. The roof, and much of the floor, has
collapsed or been ripped away. A large bin can be seen in the far end
of this chamber. Taking a closer look, you notice that the bin contains
numerous vertical slots, into which have been inserted many scrolls.
A quick examination of the scrolls reveals that they were likely of a 
magical sort. However, any magic they once may have held seems to have 
faded with the people who once lived in this place.

Only the dead calm air makes travel over the thin, dead branches of this

Upon closer examination, the boxes do indeed appear to be coffins, but they

at first seem very close together, but then diverge. Your hands touch
each wall as it slowly moves away from the other, and yet your arms 
never seem to lift up or lose contact with the surface. 

As you walk along, you feel a slight breeze, and whisps of lighter 
shades of dark move past you. A flickering light appears, and disappears
in the distance far ahead of here. Once the light is gone, you feel as
if you are in even deeper darkness.

This room is irregular shaped, and completely carved out of a smokey

jagged, but the floor and roof are perfectly smooth, flat, and parallel.
A pale light seems to radiate from the floor. Looking down, you can see
mist swirling on the floor. You reach down, but realize that the mist
is actually swirling inside the crystal. While you are enraptured by
this phenomenon, another occurs. A sheet of mist slowly emerges 
from one of the walls, as if its incorperal being is being dragged
out from hiding. It swirls through the air, and appears to be 
pulled back into the opposite wall.

The floor of this circular chamber is covered in sand. As you step

underneath the covering of sand are jagged rocks which slice and rip
at your flesh. The pale sand of the room greedily absorbs your blood 
as it is spilled!

Slowly you pull yourself up, and reach a more solid footing. A sense
of great regret and misery fills you, as you look at the sandy 
floor that is capable of devouring so many things, perhaps even your
will and soul.

drifts along the surface of the mirror. As you get closer, you can no
longer see a reflection, only blackness. The smoke almost seems to
be drifting out through the mirror. Reaching out, you touch the dark

An angular pattern has been made with the colored floor tiles here.

blocked by rock and other rubble, apparently barring all passage.
The remaining chamber in which you stand is circular, and rough, with

has been chiseled smooth. Straight lines have been carved deep into the
floor, however, and they progress from each of the four corners and walls
towards a small circle in the center of this square room.

As you approach the carved circle, and begin to hear a faint noise, like

An aisle runs lengthwise down this central portion of the cathedral,
but its positioning seems to change with each glance. The more you
stare at things, the more they seem to change, and the sense of
motion begins to make you feel ill.

You stand on a rocky shoreline which does battle with the violent,
crashing waves of a tireless sea. The uneven field of rocks extends
for some distance inland, and you can see small islands of outcropping
stone further out to sea. The sea, as if in a flanking manoever, has
cut deeply into the shore to the west. Far to the west you can see
land which extends almost out of sight to the south. This land is
heavily forested, and the trees meet the sea in a the form of a dirty,
root-choked cliff.

A decent stretch of glistening white beach lies here, backed by a

which slowly winds its way up to higher ground. The cliffs extend 
around to the east, and are an impassable obstacle there.

Looking south across the Ocean, you see endless waves and the blue

sound of the waves crashing against the cliffs to the east fills you
with awe.

You stand before two humongous gold doors that lead into the wondrous 
lands of fantasy collectively known as the Realm. Before you will be able
to reach the Realm, however, you must first pass a series of simple tests
placed here by the Demon Lord Perimal Darkling, Godling of the Realm.

To overcome these challenges you will have to use the game commands, as 
well as your intellect. If you prove yourself worthy, and reach the Realm,
you will be better prepared to deal with the denizens, both friendly and
hostile, which you will meet. By typing HELP or '?' you will get a listing
of available commands and their usage.

A large cavern, completely filled with water, encloses you as you
wander from the open, if murky, waters to the west into this area.
The cave walls are very irregular, creating a distorting image
when coupled with the natural bending of light rays by the water.
The whole cavern seems to shake gently up and down with the motion
of the currents that can be felt even here, tugging gently at you.

The cavern walls become smoother to the south, where additional chambers
might lay.

Low, smooth steps spread out before you. The steps are colored a bright
aqua, and seem to radiate a faint glow. The wide stair leads upward
to another chamber.

About halfway up the steps is a shimmering barrier. After taking a few
steps towards it, you finally realize it to be an air pocket of some
sort. Because of the ease with which you have been moving about in

water at all.

This is a most peculiar chamber. It is roughly circular, with walls a

center of the room are several colums which bow and curve noticeably
as they move from a thick base through a slender trunk and again to
a bulky union withh the chamber ceiling above. 

The colums appear to be covered in glistening scales of blue and gold,
which shimmer and twitch as if the scales of a living fish..

Upon examining the coral wall, you notice an almost imperceptable seem
which runs down the center. The shell-like crustaceans you thought were

white coral. You stagger under the initial brightness, but slowly
adjust to it enough in order to peer around.

The chamber is very large, and made entirely of white coral. The room

You find yourself in a sparsely lit, but well decorated room. All aspects
of the room seem perfectly normal, except for strange murals on each of
the walls. Each wall depicts some form of natural force in action. The 
north wall shows a scene of great winds laying low towering cities. The
east wall depicts a hurricane in the process of flooding out an entire
coastline. The south wall details a scene of thousands of creatures being
totally consumed by a raging fire. Finally, the west wall shows a scene
where great mountain ranges are being pushed up out of the earth's crust.
Also, the murals seem to strangely flicker, as if they were alive. One last
point of interest is a large plaque that has been embedded in the floor.

@dig/tel Arlindel's Testimony;room_511
#
@desc
This room is very sparsely furnished. In fact, the only furnishing in the
entire room is a solitary table. The table seems to serve as some sort of
display, as on top of the table is a book which has been left open. You
cannot touch the table or the book, however, and each attempt to do so 
results in a stinging sensation in your hand. You also notice that the walls
of the room are covered with murals, or at least, what USED to be murals.
Paint has been splattered on the walls and prevents you from seeing what 
was once there.

Immediately upon entering this room, you are hit by an onslaught of sleet!
The sleet comes nearly straight down on you, and upon looking around, you
can find no place to shelter yourself from the freakish weather. When you

than that, you DON'T see any clouds or anything else that might be causing
the downpour of sleet. The sleet seems to materialize from out of nowhere.

Upon entering this room, you notice a marked decrease in temperature. Upon
looking around, you don't find that so surprising, as the entire cavern is

where there is just a very thin sheet of ice that is safe enough to walk on.
With the exception of the ice, the cavern is completely empty.

This cavern seems to be some sort of aquarium. On either side of you the

forms of aquatic life. Upon closer inspection, you discover that there is
nothing preventing the water from flooding the cavern! None the less, the 
water stays in its place, giving you a safe, yet scenic, passage through
the cavern.

You find yourself in a completely empty cavern. However, the cavern is not
totally devoid of interest, as it seems as if the very walls of the cavern
were boiling! In fact, one would be hard pressed to come up with a better
description of what you see before you. It is not entirely unlike standing
in the middle of a bubble, with the exception of the solid rock floor that
you are currently standing on. You can now feel the heat coming off of the
boiling walls, but the heat is only strong enough to cause you some slight
discomfort, not any real physical harm.

#
@desc
Upon entering this room, you are immediately stunned by the sheer beauty
of the scene before your eyes. Majestic fountains abound throughout the
whole room, and great sheets of water, like giant waterfalls, fall down
along the entire length and height of the walls. The fountains are magically
lit by some unseen light source, and each has its own color of the rainbow.
The waterfalls are similarly lit, except that the light changes in both
intensity and in its color in a somewhat irregular fashion. Standing all 
alone in the middle of the room is a statue of a man dressed in what seems
to be the robes of a wizard. You can just see that there is some writing
on the base of the statue.

Upon entering the room, you can't help but notice the sudden increase
in humidity. However, the rise in humidity as not surprising, considering
that the room seems to be filled with steam. While searches for the source
of the steam prove unfruitful, you still determine that the steam is 
replenished somehow, as the steam never dissipates, and the temperature
of the room never drops. It doesn't take long until your clothes are soaked
through, from head to toe. Water (or sweat) streams down your face, as the
steam bath begins to take its full effect on you.

The walls of this long, but cramped, chamber are made of smooth stones
which glow dimly. The waves of heat they send out suck the air from
your lungs, and crush you under the wieght of your own load. Shimmering
lines of heat are visible here, as moisture is rapidly pulled from your
body. The path through the room appears the safest way through the chamber,
as to move near the walls is to invite damage.

that is detailed with a picture of a great city basking in brilliant

Thick, acrid smoke fills this room. At first you try to bend low beneath

the far exit. It seems to be the sole escape from the choking morass
which clogs your lungs.

Suddenly, you find yourself in the middle of an immense lava flow! You cannot
see any end to the molten rock, as the flow spreads out to the horizons.
Strangly, however, the lava seems to totally avoid the narrow path which you
are on. So, for the meantime, you are presently safe. There seems to be no
source of the magma flow, as there is not one volcano in sight. However, the
flow shows no sign of ceasing.

It is hard to concentrate on anything in this "room" as everthing in it is
in constant motion. It is equally difficult to descibe what you see before
you except maybe by the phrase, "Standing in the middle of an avalanche",
only because that is exactly what it seems like. There is falling rock
everywhere, except for a small path through the middle of all the chaos,
which the rocks seem to magically avoid. It is impossible to determine
where the rocks are coming from, nor can you see where they are going.
All you can tell is that the rocks don't seem to be piling up anywhere.
Also, with the exception of the path, there is no evidence of a floor
anywhere, nor is there any ceiling or walls.

Suddenly, you find yourself standing in the middle of a desert! Sand swirls

it doesn't seem to be too hot, as one would expect with any desert. You also
notice a small path through the middle of all the sand. It is devoid of any
trace of the desert around it and seems very safe. You currently find 
yourself in the middle of the path and thanks the Gods for it, as the sand
storms just off of the path seem pretty nasty.

This room has nothing in it whatsoever, just a dirt floor and walls which
were carved right out of the rock. However the walls are covered from

you also discover a small bronze plate embedded in the west wall. It appears

You find yourself standing in a grand hall, the likes of something one would

as if of its own accord, forming the gigantic wall before you.

As you turn around to survey your position, you are greeted by another

This chamber is circular, and has a very high ceiling. In the center of

a result of some complicated and unseen feat of optics and construction,
a single ray of light shines down upon the statue from above, its
origin unseen.

huge blocks of dark stone, and provides the first physical barrier
to the advance of the sea.

single slab of stone. A thin vein of gold runs through this slab, starting
at the walls and spiralling gradually inward in a way that is too
concentric to be natural.

In the center of the chamber is a huge stone table, which is round in

This large, rectangular chamber is dominated by what appears to be
a rough hewn block of ice. The ice is very clear, but very dry and
only slightly cool to the touch. The giant block rests upon a block
of black marble, which is in turn set into a cobbled floor.

Inside the strange block of ice can be seen a stately warrior, dressed
in full armor and bearing a dragon upon his shield. The warrior
has no visible wounds, and appears to be merely resting peacefully.

The room you stand in is lit by some unknown source. A large circle of black
stone faces upright in the middle of the room, a ring of elder glyphs cut
into the stone around an avellan cross. Thongs possibly designed to tie
wrists and ankles are situated at likely spots on the disk of black marble.
Opposite the stone altar is a black circular mirror, reflecting what little
light there is in this room.

Misty tendrils stream down from the circle of black glass high above like
spiderwebs, seeming to undulate into and out of the black mirror. Something
seems to move inside the writhing mass of darkness.

You stand in the lower hall of a solid, circular tower. It rises up
almost a hundred feet, and you can scale the heights from the inside
by following the stone steps which wind about its circumference.
The tower has no windows, aperatures, or other adornments upon its
smooth features, and has been constructed of giant blocks of stone
which appear immune to the effects of time.
