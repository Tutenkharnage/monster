#
@desc
This is the first room of many in the Realm of Monster. Once things get 
rolling, a simple series of rooms will be installed which will force
new players to get used to the Monster commands in order to reach the 
actual world. For now however, we will be cheesey, and merely deposit
you in the Realm at a convenient location. 

[Please note: The cheesey shortcut has finally been circumvented. We
will keep the above description however, because we like it so much.]

Your life essence is being recycled. Please wait a moment while most
of your previous short-comings are filtered out, and a suitable
replacement body is manufactured.
#
@dig/tel Red street;room_3
#
@set here/record_id = 3
#
@desc
Residents of the city call out their windows and exchange pleasantries
over you head. Ribbons hang from some of the buildings and you see
they become more varied and clustered further east.
#
@dig/tel Sewer Entrance;room_4
#
@set here/record_id = 4
#
@desc
You stand at the entrance to the vast sewer system located beneath the
City of Tai-Tastigon. Sprawling out in all directions, the sewers lay
like the web of a giant spider - or like the maze of some deranged minotaur.
The stench here is not as foul as you might at first have guessed, and your
nose quickly adapts to the malorific odor.
#
@dig/tel Tu'matei Alras;room_5
#
@set here/record_id = 5
#
@desc
You are in the shaded land of soft color in which the Fair Folk
reside to escape the troubles of the mortal world.

Rest well, and do not be troubled by mortal cares.
#
@dig/tel grey hills;room_6
#
@set here/record_id = 6
#
@desc
The air is cold and stale here. You can still see the City and that
is a great comfort in this cheerless land. Ashes swirl around you,
blown in from the dark east.

It would be very easy to lose oneself here.
#
@dig/tel grey hills;room_7
#
@set here/record_id = 7
#
@desc
Cries of horror now wind their way through the hills. Perchance
there has been murder here. Travellers must be wary of haunts
that seek for living flesh.
#
@dig/tel wasteland;room_8
#
@set here/record_id = 8
#
@set here/trap_chance = 35
#
@set here/trap_to = 6

@desc
There is little life here. The crust of the land is thin and all
sorts of loathesome creatures make their home here.

#
@dig/tel grey hills;room_9
#
@set here/record_id = 9
#
@desc
You have lost sight of the city but there is something that looks like
a dwelling further among the hills. It is quickly growing dark and
it might be a good idea to investigate another time..
#
@dig/tel Circle of Fire;room_10
#
@set here/record_id = 10
#
@dig/tel Goblin Mural Room;room_11
#
@set here/record_id = 11
#
@desc
The south wall of this chamber is long, and has been artificially 
flattened and smoothed. The rest of the chamber has been left in its
rough, natural state. The south wall is decorated with a crude, and
disturbing, mural.

The mural depicts stocky humanoid creatures laying waste to a human 
village, underneath a blood red moon. Fires burn in the background, and
scenes of extreme violence are prominantly displayed in the foreground.
#
@dig/tel Pit of Fire;room_12
#
@set here/record_id = 12
#
@desc
You may alter your pitiful existence in this portion of the Netherworld.
Considering how much time you spend here, it might be an advisable
course of action.

#
@dig/tel The Stone Circle;room_13
#
@set here/record_id = 13
#
@desc
A multitude of gigantic, dark hued stones are arranged in a circular 
pattern here. Concentric with this arrangement is one of smaller blue
stones. At the very center of the pattern, the ground has been covered
with marble tiles.

This stunning display stands on a mound of solid ground rising out of
the surrounding swamp. A feeling of immense natural power pervades the
entire area.
#
@dig/tel Marsh;room_14
#
@set here/record_id = 14
#
@desc
A strange mist hugs the surface of the marsh waters, filling you wish
a strong feeling of dread.

The marsh is roughly chest-deep, but dangerous sink holes and drop-offs
abound, making all progress slow to a painful crawl.
#
@dig/tel Fens;room_15
#
@set here/record_id = 15
#
@desc
Despite the waist deep muck you are now forced to wade through, the
population of trees has thinned only slightly. Tall, dark trees rise
up from the dark mud and water. The trunks of these trees are unusually
smooth, and glisten with moisture as if they were a living, amphibian 
skin.
#
@dig/tel Swamp;room_16
#
@set here/record_id = 16
#
@desc
You are in a swamp.

#
@dig/tel Great Bog;room_17
#
@set here/record_id = 17
#
@desc
More so here than in any other area of the swamp or forest, you feel 
as though you are in immediate peril. The mist and swamp gas swirl as
if to purposely confuse you. The strange voice of the wind seems to
speak to you of the unyielding embrace of death that waits for you at 
the abyss bottom of a hidden bog or sink hole. Your mind screams with
fear, and your limbs are reluctant to follow your commands, for fear of
making the tragic mis-step that can only lead to a suffocating doom.
#
@dig/tel Row of Megaliths;room_18
#
@set here/record_id = 18
#
@desc
An ancient footpath runs from the clearing to the north, south to the
circle of stones. Astride the path are a series of giant megaliths placed
at evenly spaced intervals.

The megaliths are carved from single blocks of a dark stone. Reaching a
height of 15 feet, the impassionate faces carved onto the rock surfaces
stare down upon travellers with indifference.
#
@dig/tel Swampy Forest;room_19
#
@set here/record_id = 19
#
@desc
The ground here is composed of a muddy slush thickly covered with old 
leaves. The forest is once again dense, and absent of all but the faintest
slivers of light creeping through the leafy canopy. With every step you
take you sink to your knees, and must struggle to free yourself from the
persistant grasp of the amorpheous earth.
#
@dig/tel Cedar Forest;room_20
#
@set here/record_id = 20
#
@desc
You are finding it hard to determine distance and time this deep in the
forest. The unending multitude presents a constant aspect to you, defying
your senses. A thin mist floats through the forest, only adding to your
apprehension.
#
@dig/tel Cyprus Trees;room_21
#
@set here/record_id = 21
#
@desc
Twisted cyprus trees rise up here, intertwining in a sinister display.
A seemingly continuous palisade of cyprus trees runs north to south,
complicating any attempted passage to the west.

The sounds of the forest can be heard here, but to the west are noises
of an unknown nature. You wonder if it would not be better to avoid 
the dark tangle of woods that lies west of here.
#
@dig/tel Endless Forest;room_22
#
@set here/record_id = 22
#
@dig/tel Grey Steppe;room_23
#
@set here/record_id = 23
#
@desc
The grey lands before you contradict the promise of the sun gate...
they are grey and unwelcome. The eastern lands were once a thriving
market but now restless spirits have taken over the land. The hills
are now hollow, lost souls breaking out from beneath the crust of the
rotton land.

Nothing stays dead here for long..
#
@dig/tel Entrance Hall;room_24
#
@set here/record_id = 24
#
@desc
A vast chamber of ice surrounds you, encompassing you in a giant tomb
of cold darkness. The walls of the chamber tier inward towards the
ceiling, and appear to have been painstakingly carved by magical hands.

From somewhere far, far above, a thin beam of light enters this 
towering crevace, and is reflected and scattered from surface to 
surface. The ice absorbs the light somewhat, giving back a deep blue
hue that speaks of natural wonders un-beholden to Mankind.
#
@dig/tel Redwood Forest;room_25
#
@set here/record_id = 25
#
@desc
Lurching up like a wooden mountain here are giant redwood trees. The
reddish trunks are of impressive circumference, and rise straight up to
an incredible height. Even the Great Oaks are dwarfed by these monsters,
though the redwoods do not exude the same aura.

The ground here is bare, for the most part. The giant trees are seperated 
by large distances, providing a relief from the claustrophobic confines 
of the inner forest.
#
@dig/tel Great Redwood;room_26
#
@set here/record_id = 26
#
@desc
A lone tree is immense proportions towers towards the sky here. Its
gigantic roots ripple beneath the ground like some predator fish
caught at the surface of a frozen lake. Its base is as wide around
as a tower, and its rough bark nearly as tough as stone.

Bits of leaves drift down from above like a faint snowfall, and even
though no other trees can grow so close to this monster, the forest
here is dark and forboding.

#
@dig/tel Forest Crossroads;room_27
#
@set here/record_id = 27
#
@desc
The trees thin out here, allowing a small clearing that shows signs of
traffic. Unlike most of the Great Forest, light streams down upon you 
here, and smaller brushes and foliage flourish.

Ancient stones of immense size can be seen to the south of here, while 
the steady sounds of a slow moving, but mighty, river can be heard to
the west.
#
@dig/tel smoking ruins;room_28
#
@set here/record_id = 28
#
@dig/tel Barrow Mound;room_29
#
@set here/record_id = 29
#
@desc
Rising up in an exposed fashion, unsheltered from the protective forest,
is a group of grassy mounds. These are ancient barrow mounds, holding the
remains and treasures of personages long forgotten by all except the Druids.

The barrows are apparently roofed in wood and stone, and covered with earth.
The largest of the mounds exudes a feeling of extreme age, and has fallen
prey to the effects of erosion. Large blocks of solid stone are visible.
While you might be able to pry one loose, and venture into the blackness
of the ancient grave, your better judgement tells you that such actions
might be unwise.
#
@dig/tel Keep Entrance;room_30

@dig/tel foyer;room_31
#
@set here/record_id = 31
#
@dig/tel Hall of Honor;room_32
#
@set here/record_id = 32
#
@desc
In the dim light you can see the walls of the great hall of covered
in tapestries, now tattered and burned and difficult to read. What
you can see of the stories told therein are confusing, giving little
information as to whom the inhabitants of this place were. Or how they
died..

Set within the walls are three doorways, each with an inscription in
faded letters above.

The words speak of danger and death.
#
@dig/tel World Window;room_33
#
@set here/record_id = 33
#
@dig/tel Troll Tunnel;room_34
#
@set here/record_id = 34
#
@desc
This tunnel is quite large, as if made for the passage of creatures 
much larger than that of a human. The bottom tunnel surface is flat,
while the top is arched.

The tunnel has been rough-hewn, and is unlit. You can feel your way 
through without much difficulty however.
#
@dig/tel Dark of the Moon;room_35

#
@dig/tel tomb of Darkmage;room_38
#
@set here/record_id = 38
#
@desc
You arrive at the tomb of Darkmage, the wizard.  An eerie silence hangs in
the air.  A light breeze sends an occassional chill through your body.  The
tomb itself is a large concrete structure, simply crafted in a Gothic style.
Stairs lead up to a huge set of double doors.  The doors themselves have no
handles.  
The cemetery road extends east and west from here, splitting around the
tomb itself.  There are small gates along the north and south edges of the
road, separating the tomb area from the cemetery proper.
All is silent.
*Very* silent.
#
@dig/tel sewer1;room_39
#
@set here/record_id = 39
#
@dig/tel War Dance;room_40
#
@set here/record_id = 40
#
@desc
You have entered a room devoted solely to the arts of war, magical and
otherwise. The room is bare of any furnishing or design and is dominated
by 4 exits that lead from the four walls on the points of the compass.

#
@dig/tel Gaping Pit of Doom;room_41
#
@set here/record_id = 41
#
@desc
A sputtering torch provides thankful light at this point. The tunnel 
widens out, and you are faced with a large, black hole that seems to 
devour the tunnel, and drag it down into the hidden depths below. 

The dark pit facing you is rough edged, and probably not made by
humanoid hands. You should be able to make a descent.
#
@dig/tel Doom Pit Bottom;room_42
#
@set here/record_id = 42
#
@desc
You stand at the bottom of a black pit. The skeletons of small animals
who have fallen into the pit and died can be seen scattered about. 

A small hole has been knocked in the eastern wall of the pit bottom. The
hole is large enough for you to crawl through comfortably, and could 
accomodate a larger creature as well.
#
@dig/tel Cave of Mangled Elf;room_43
#
@set here/record_id = 43
#
@desc
Lying near the center of this cave is the body of a humanoid creature.
It is difficult to tell exactly what race it is from, as it has been 
horribly beaten and disfigured, not to mention partially decayed.

The still form has been manacled to an iron ring set in the floor of
the chamber. Bloody tracks on the floor show the body was dragged in
from the west and has not moved since being chained here. It is 
therefore likely that the body was chained here after death. Perhaps
this is a warning?
#
@dig/tel Cave of Skinned Man;room_44
#
@set here/record_id = 44
#
@desc
Carefully positioned in the center of the this cave are the remains of
a man. The body has been skinned skillfully, and has been laid in a spread
eagle position. A 'U' shaped iron bar has been pounded into the rock 
floor around the chest of the body, pinning the torso tightly to the floor.

It occurs to you that instead of being a warning, this might actually
be a marker laid for the benefit of those who might inhabit these
caves. You shudder to think of what kind of beings would leave a skinned
body as a path marker.
#
@dig/tel Cave of Eaten Dwarf;room_45
#
@set here/record_id = 45
#
@desc
Another grisly marker has been left here. This time it is a Dwarf, whose
legs have been gnawed off. An iron spike has been driven directly 
through the body. It dawns on you that these means of restraint are 
likely employed to keep wild creatures from removing the path markers.
#
@dig/tel Fire Leaping;room_46
#
@set here/record_id = 46
#
@desc
You are in a fiery warm room that glows with the power of flame
that erupts from the bowels of the earth. All around you flames
seem to flicker on the edge of your vision, tantalizing you with
sights of riches never before known.
#
@dig/tel Cave of Violated Pig;room_47
#
@set here/record_id = 47
#
@desc
A very large lance has been driven lengthwise through the body of a wild
pig here. The lance has been thrust into the cavern floor, upending 
the poor animal, and suspending it upside down. A large pool of dried 
blood has collected at the base of the weapon.
#
@dig/tel Grand Troll Cavern;room_48
#
@set here/record_id = 48
#
@desc
This cavern is very large, and is strewn with large rocks that have 
been slightly chiseled, and serve as chairs. Three deep fire pits, 
ringed with stones, are situated throughout the chamber. A large 
mammoth tusk and a rough iron bell are suspended from a wooden 
superstructure in the north end of the room. The bell has no clapper,
but is instead rung by swinging the tusk into it.

Near the bell are some stone steps which lead up to a throne carved into
a giant boulder.

@dig/tel Archive Basement;room_51
#
@set here/record_id = 51
#
@desc
Several large racks run the length of this room. Each of the racks
is filled with scrolls, books, and animal hides. Markings indicate
that the scolls and such are kept in some mysterious order. A quick
examination indicates that the writings are in a variety of languages.
#
@dig/tel Mead Hall Basement;room_52
#
@set here/record_id = 52
#
@desc
This room is cluttered with wooden kegs and sacks of vegetables and fruit.
There is very little space to maneouver, but a path has been cleared 
from the stairs to the western portal. 

Sounds of singing and revelry drift down the stairs from above.

@dig/tel Wellspring of Ulster;room_55
#
@set here/record_id = 55
#
@desc
The walls of this room are timber and stone, while the floor has largely
been covered with smooth stones obtained from a riverbed. In the
center of the floor is a large, clear spring. 

A large root disrupts the stone patttern on the floor as it travels
from a room to the west towards the spring. 
#
@dig/tel Bhalge Beltaine;room_56
#
@set here/record_id = 56
#
@desc
The walls of this room are rough-hewn, while the floor is smooth blocks
of polished stone. The floor has been covered with symbols, glyphs, and
lines, some clearly indicating constellations. Small holes have been 
sunk from the surface somewhere down into the walls and ceiling of this
room. Through some of the holes, light from the sun, or moon, strikes
the floor markings.

It is here that the passage of seasons and time is observed. 
#
@dig/tel Lake Bottom;room_57
#
@set here/record_id = 57
#
@set here/trap_chance = 30
#
@set here/trap_to = 6
#
@desc
The lake bottom does not look like you would expect. Instead of being
rough and uneven, it is regular and flat, as if the floor has been
constructed of stone by some immense, forgotten giant. Small plants
grow on the bottom, and a wide variety of fish can be seen. They do 
not seem to notice you as you stand here, completely out of your
element.
#
@dig/tel Ancient City Square;room_58
#
@set here/record_id = 58
#
@desc
You stand on a wide cobble plain from which narrow roads radiate out
in the cardinal directions. Once cluttered with arches and columns, this
square now contains only their crumbled remains. 

Though far underground, a hazy light fills the area of the city. The air
is still, and has a mineral flavor to it. The only sound you can here is
that of your echoing footsteps.
#
@dig/tel Collapsed Gate;room_59
#
@set here/record_id = 59
#
@desc
A great gate, what was once a primary entrance into the city, lies
before you. Its top crossmember is a gigantic single piece of stone,
which has cracked and fallen, like an animal whose back has broken.

Just beyond the gateway lies the rough rock of the cavern wall. The
gateway, however, is filled with rubble and debris, blocking any 
regress.
#
@dig/tel Via Necromantia;room_60
#
@set here/record_id = 60
#
@desc
You find yourself walking along what must have been the main road of this
ancient city. It is wider than most, but the buildings that line the road
come up right to the edge of the avenue. The buildings are still standing
along the road, which is more than what can be said for much of the city.

The condition of the remains improves to the west.

@dig/tel Earth Moving;room_65
#
@set here/record_id = 65
#
@desc
This room is one of peace and of life, representative of living things
as well as the destructive forces of nature now held at bay. It is
a dark room, lit only by stones that are set in the wall and glow
with an earthy light. The floor is clay and lichens grow along the
walls over stones and soil. In the center of the room is a stone
dais with a book opened and chained to the floor upon it.

@dig/tel Overgrown Trail;room_67
#
@set here/record_id = 67
#
@desc
The branches that overhang the pathway are particularly low at this
point. They seem almost animated as they reach towards you and clutch at
your belongings and person. Only the faintest breath of wind aids their
motion.

The trail seems to widen somewhat to the west.

#
@dig/tel Overgrown Trail;room_68
#
@set here/record_id = 68
#
@desc
This brush chocked trail is reminiscent of a cave tunnel. Ancient trees
hug the pathway, and cover you with a low roof of wooden boughs. The light
that does filter down is dim, and more than a little surreal.

A thick coating of old leaves covers the ground, and announces your passage
with a muffled voice.

#
@dig/tel Great Oaks;room_69
#
@set here/record_id = 69
#
@desc
Here lies the border to the great forests of the Druids. A nearly solid
wall of towering oaks lies west. A trail leads into a small, cave-like
break in the tree front.

This is a stark demarcation. West lie dark wilds accompanied by the 
sounds of its fierce denizens. East are the meadows and roads of a more
cultivated environ. The break in the treeline at the trail lies west. 
One moment it looks inviting, but the next it seems to mock you with a
tempting and forbodingly silent laughter.

Thin columns rise up to greet the hazy air here. Marble steps lead

Small bronze statues still stand on pedstals here, depicting 
personages long forgotten by Mankind.
#
@dig/tel Water Flowing;room_71
#
@set here/record_id = 71
#
@desc
You are overwhelmed by the spirit of water flowing through this room.
The walls are blue and green and seem to be moving, the pale fronds
of seaweed and water grass swaying in a nonexistant tide.

In the center of the room upon a small dais is a book bound in
pale leather, its pages opened and anchored.

You stand at the far wall of a busy market center stretching to all sides.
Beside you is a stone throne of some sort, stained with what could be dried
blood. This is the Mercy seat where judgement is dispensed in Tai-tastigon.
You notice that despite the busy nature of the square, this area remains
empty...

There is a small tattered piece of paper stuck to the stone seat
beside you...
Apparently the leavings of a former victim.

You stand before a stall displaying many types of light armory. On the

and you can see an attractive horned helm in a prominent position
among the goods.

You have entered the columned structure of the Temple of Apollo. The 
long center of the structure faces a bronze statue of the god. Most
of the temple is open to the elements, as the roof contains a large
opening, but the statue is shaded. A small fountain is beside the
statue. Metaphysical thinkers, as well as worshippers, often come 
here to contemplate the world, and bask in the glory of the sun god.
Priests can be seen moving about the Temple. Occassionallythey venture

You are in a region of low, rolling hills. Vegetation and grasses abound,
but they seem to lack any sense of color. The landscape around you seems
cloaked in hues of gray. 

Looking up, you can see the sun, but it too seems to have only a faint
hint of yellow to outshine the substance of gray.

A wall of dark clouds lies low on the horizon to the south.

A grisly sight greets you here, where the tunnel widens slightly.
Human remains, obviously very old but surprisingly well preserved,
have been dragged into the center of the passage, where they are
feasted upon by a horde of malevolent rats. The rats hungrily 
devour what remains of the rotted flesh, turning only occassionally
to glance at you. The sound their feasting makes is terrifying...

You stand in a tunnnel which has been roughly burrowed into the earth.
Loose dirt occasionally falls in clumps, and you are struck by a 
severe claustrophibic feeling, as if the fragile passage might 
collapse in on you at any time. 

It is unclear whether this place was used as a crude catacomb, or 
whether it was merely burrowed through a heavily used grave yard.
In any event, human and humanoid remains push through the walls 
of the tunnel at several levels. The bones are evidently very old,
but some of the remains have been preserved remarkably well.

To the north and east loom the stark shapes of the Ebonbane Mountains.
Between these two gigantic entities, this quaint patch of serenity

You are standing in a damp, forested gulley that runs north and south.
To the west is the rocky wall of the gulley, which appears extremely
difficult to scale. The ground slopes downward slightly to the north.

The trees on the banks of the gulley lean inward, as if to topple over

Jagged rock walls rise abruptly out of the forest before you. You stand
at the damp bottom of a forested ravine. The cliffs to your north and
south are insurmountable without additional assistance and equipment.

A dark cave leads north into the face of the mountains. The cave mouth
has been carved and decorated with strange and grotesque faces and

The lake upon which you float is fairly calm. Its dark blue waters 
indicate considerable, perhaps unnatural, depth. The lake is surrounded
on all edges by a green border of forest.

Peering into the lake, it seems as if the water below the surface is

You stand inside the base of a tower constructed of stone, earth, and
wooden timbers. The floor is earthen, and packed hard by many years of
use. Timbers hold back the weight of earth outside the walls, and have
been decoratively carved withh strange symbols. The roof is open to 
the second floor, and thus the elements. An iron lamp hangs down from
the rafters near the wall.

In the center of this room is a fire, and a large stack of red-hot stones.
A mechanical contraption of mysterious working keeps a continuous stream
of water trickling down onto the rocks to be vaporized. 

Each rock has a unique glyph carved into its surface, which stands out 
in brilliant white to contrast with the red of the surface. It is 
apparent that more than just ordinary steam is rising from the rocks.
Strange colors seem to appear, disappear, and float in the rising 
column of steam that travels upward through the iron grate that serves
as a ceiling.

From this vantage point, you can look out across the lake and forests,

This tower is completely closed, and without windows. The ceiling is very

Thick mist and steam fill the room, reflected by the low ceiling. The
temperature here is very high, and the humidity is almost unbearable.
The vapors seem to be rising from the floor...you suddenly notice that
the floor is actually a metal grate, allowing steam to rise from below.
Due to the poor lighting, and thick steam, you are unable to see into
the room below.

Many of the Halls and chambers of the Druid Palace were constructed as

them all, and enclose the entire Palace.

This irregular structure exhibits a thatched roof, and a floor that is
partially hardwood, and partially stone flagging.

This grand hall is the court of the Druid Emperor. The floor of the hall
is about two feet higher than the rest of the Palace grounds, requiring
one to step up into the room. The floor itself is parqueyed wood that has
been given a high shine. All the doors into this hall are large, wooden,
double doors bound in iron. 

A dark wood throne, enriched with exquisite carvings, rests facing the
eastern door. A large semi-circle has been inscribed into the floor in
front of the throne, with a gold disc inlaid at the center of the 
spine.

Growing into, or out of, the western wall of this room is an oak of wide

ordinary tree, as one half is burning in a blaze of flames, while the
other half flourishes in green, leafy splendor.

The flames have a greenish tint, and crackle vigorously, but the tree
is not consumed, and the hall not harmed. 

You notice that the tree seems to be growing out of the floor of this
room as well as the wall.

This area is more aptly described as a junction of the ramparts. A small
palisade runs along its corner, but it otherwise has no walls or
distinguishing partitions. 

At the center of the juncture is a raised platform of stone upon which
sits a large bronze brazier. In the brazier burns a greenish flame that
is apparently unaffected by the winds. It is said that in times of trouble,
this flame will rise up into an inferno as a signal to the Gods who are
said to reside to the northwest of the Endless Forest. Upon seeing the
signal, the Gods will don their weapons and come to the aid of the Druids.

You stand inside a tapering tower, with a long, narrow window situated 
in each of the cardinal directions. The floor has been tiled with a 
marble, which has in turn been decorated with strange patterns and symbols.

As you walk through the room, you encounter unusually strong air currents,
apparently stemming from the four windows. At the center of the room you
are buffetted with surprising violence. As the winds shake you, strange
visions come unbidden to your mind...a craggy fortress atop a mesa, green
valleys and mountains, a flapping raven, a bolting stag, a flood of 
crimson, scarlet, blue, and green, black and white trees...

This room is bare, and without decoration. Strange howls, groans and other

directions.

those who would listen, and prosper by them. It is also here, that
travelling bards often deliver epic poems from.

A large oak and bronze table dominates this room. On its top are

writing has been transfered. The table sits in the middle of the room,
and long shelves run the length of the walls. The shelves hold more
scrolls and books, and are marked in some obscure record system.

Though the Druids have long forsaken written records, the tumultuous
events of the recent epochs have demanded a more permanent attention
than the bards and minstels could provide.

into the room, the light from behind you seems to fade. The room did
not seem very long, but it feels as if you have walked for a very long
time here in the dark without encountering a wall. 

You get the feeling that there are many portals here, if one only knows
how to open them. With a shudder, you are thankful that such knowledge
escapes you.

This room is a very large rectangular structure, framed with great timbers,

and armor of the Red Branch Warriors are kept. Shields, spears, and swords
virtually paper the walls, and with each set of equipment are the 
severed heads coated with lime that serve as trophies of valor.

There are no tables or places to recline in this room, and it is guarded
by strong magic which prevents and but the rightful owners to draw
the weapons from the wall.

for sitting and reclining. 

It is here that craftsmen, smiths, and travelling merchants often come
to sell their wares and weapons to the Druids. Currently, several

This area is small, compared to most of the chambers and buildings in the

appearance. The timbers in the walls and roof have been carved into a
series of figurines, inlaid with silver. The floor seems to be one, huge,
flat stone. The stone has been carved to depict battle scenes. Almost
the entire eastern wall has been covered with a silver foil, upon which

Despite being well underground, a faint light exists in the cavern. The

@dig/tel Jaws of Stone;room_137
#
@set here/record_id = 137

The structure known as the Jaws of Stone is the northern entrance to the
tunnels and caves, not to mention the Warlord's fortress, that run under
the mountains. The structure derives its name, quite logically, from the
stone work that has been done around the cave mouth that leads into the
underground darkness. The cave mouth has been carved and worked to 
appear like a giant gaping mouth, resplendent with viscious fangs and teeth.

South lies the unknown darkness of the underground, as well as the entrance 
to the Warlord's fortress. North stretches open land.

A large passageway has been cut at this point into the eastern wall

You stand on a ledge looking out into a narrow well of a cave. Water
from above somewhere, drops in a small, but beautiful waterfall, past
this position and into a pool below you. 

The sound of the falling water is loud, but not overbearing. Where you
stand on the ledge receives a cool spray of water. You might be able to 
climb from where you are now up or down the side of the cylindrical
cavern of whose mid-wall you are now positioned on.

You stand in a relatively shallow cavern pool. The water is clear, fresh,
and cool, but the rock beneath the water is a light shade of green, 
giving a strange tint to the entire scene.

Water falls in a heavy rain from above. Looking up you notice that the
pool is merely the floor of a very large, cylindrical cavern. A small
underground river apparently runs into the top of this cavern, resulting
in a pleasing waterfall.

A small torrent bursts out of the northern wall here, and rushes

A narrow walkway leads through this long, man-made chamber. A wider step
area flanks either side of the walkway and leading up to the walls. 
Each of the two long walls here has been coated with a marble veneer,
constructed in a diagonal pattern of alternating stone types. 

Secured against the wall are weapons of various sorts and varieties. Most
appear very old, and a bit outlandish. Out of curiosity, you attempt to
remove one from the wall, but a strange force prevents you.

of a truly exotic nature. There is no apparent means of supplying heat,
and no bellows. The forge does not appear to have seen use in a long time.

As you approach to investigate, the coals in the forge's heart begin to
glow with a faint green light. You can feel no heat, however.

while to the west is more solid footing.

This chamber is round, and has a jagged ceiling consisting of a multitude
of stalactites. Slight trickles of water run down the formations from the
ceiling, creating a minor drizzle within the chamber. A small pool of 
water has collected in one corner.

The cave floor is covered with bones of all sizes, some very large. While
it is clear that the bones do not all come from one creature, a coherent
skeleton of something akin to a mammoth can be discerned.

You stand on a flat expanse of green which intercedes the forest and the

This room has been hollowed out of the earth. The stone steps leading 
up were clearly an afterthought. Some timbers serve to keep the ground
from rushing in and collapsing the room.

A large tree grows out of the earthen floor of this room, and extends 
upward into the rooms above. Many large roots are visible, and a 
particularly large one snakes its way across the floor into the
room to the east. You touch the trunk of the tree...and are oddly greeted

You stand on the battlements of the Cliff-face Tower, which thrusts
itself out of the heart of the mountainside in order to peer down
upon the slopes and vale below.

The battlements are buffeted by a strong wind that invigorates you. 
Rising still further above the battlements is the thin turret of the
tower. You feel the strong urge to climb up to the highest point 
possible, in order to see all of creation.

#
@desc
This is the southern end of the Tunnel of Daggers. The passageway has
been widened and given extra heigth to the point where a room, of sorts,
exists here. While this area is unlit, light spills over from a side
passageway that leads west.

In the faint illumination, you are greated by an impressive stone portal
that is astride the corridor leading south. The gateway is open, and is
covered with runes.

#
@desc
You are now just inside the outer gateway of the Warlord's mountain
fortress. Unlike the Tunnel of Daggers, the corridor here has been
carved out of the rock with great precision and skill. The wall and
floor surfaces are smooth.

South of here lies the first hall of the stronghold. Passage south,
however, can be effectively blocked through the use of the portcullis
that has been installed here. Fortunately, the portcullis is currently
raised, allowing you to slip into the stronghold with only stooping 
slightly, should you wish.

This small room is half natural cave, and carved out of the rock. The 
floor has been chiseled smooth, while the roof is high and covered with
tiny stalactites. A warm fire burns here, and some meat can be seen
roasting over it.

This room serves as a guard post, and a sentry is usually placed here
at all times.

@desc
This cavernous hall existed long before this stronghold was ever built,
though the builders remain unknown. The room is very large in size, but
its occupants are even more impressive.

At first glance, you are greeted by a bristling army of soldiers and
lances. On closer examination you realize that the soldiers are actually
terra cotta statues. Rank upon rank they lie, arranged in companies and
echelons, 1000 in all. Legends say that these soldiers were once real men,
and will return to animated life yet again.

This hall is relatively small, but has a certain stately air about it.
It is here that recognition is payed to the sporadic Kings that have
been associated with the Warriors and their Lord throughout the ages.

High on the walls of this room, are icons depicting 10 previous Kings.
No attempt has been made to indicate the name appropriate to each 
icon, and some of the subjects have faded from the collective memory
of Man.

This chamber is of moderate size, and is clothed in tapestries of
blood red. Trophies from various battle victories are prominantly in
view here, while murals depicting past glory are draped by the red cloth
that cascades down from the ceiling.

A pile of small skulls commemorates a victory over a large force of 
Goblins, while a great sarcophogus serves as a reminder of campaigns
raged against the undead Mummy Kings.

You now stand at the central landing of a truly impressive stairway.
Very wide steps accompanied by stone railings arch out of sight both
above and below this point. The general darkness of this area enhances
the spidery appearance of the stairway as it reaches out, seemingly 
without support, into the dark void of some central cavern. You can peer
over the railing of the landing, and look into black darkness above and
below, puncuated only by the grey form of the winding steps.

You stand in a narrow concourse bedecked with arches and buttresses. The
ceiling is very high, and the intricate nature of the architecture lends
itself to more stately purposes, akin to that of a chapel. The flagstones
that floor the walkway of the concourse are "x's" that fit together 
snugly. Torches are placed at even intervals to provide light.

Your footsteps echo majestically as you stroll down the concourse.

This room is square, but has a domed roof. Small cords hang down from 
the center of the dome to be wrapped around metal rods that run along 
each of the walls. Tapestries hang from the cords.

The largest tapestry depicts a lone warrior, bloodied and mortally
wounded, engaged in battle against a horde of ghastly white humanoids.

This room has the same flagstones as the concourse to the east.

This chamber is bare, and generally lacking of interesting features
save two items. One is the fresco that has been made upon the north wall.
It depicts a group of warriors defending a tattered banner against a 
host of large, fanged creatures. 

The other item is a large block of quartz which has been set flush into
the floor. Trapped inside the quartz is a sword. It is here that the 
warriors of the keep swear oaths upon the quartz, and the sword within.

This chamber is oval in shape, and is rather small. A well sunk through 
the stone floor dominates this room. A low lip has been constructed 
around the well.

Peering down the well, you can see only blackness. You can hear the
sounds of sloshing water below, but it is fairly deep. A small winch
and bucket are suspended from the low ceiling. It has been fabled
that the well water possesses powers of truth, and that no falsehood can
be heard over the sounds of the water below.

This market is devoted to more frivolous items..precious stones,
silks and wrought iron.
You notice, however, a small rubbish pile in the shadow of a house
that has some possibilities..

When you dig through the pile you find old axes and hatchets, probably
to be shipped to the forest land but abandoned now. Iron bars from
which the artisans make their intricate lamps, lie in a pile unnoticed.
An enterprising man might make due with one of these as a weapon.

#
@desc
This passage is very narrow, and very tall. There is barely enough room
for one armored man to walk down the passage, but the ceiling risis
some additional twenty feet above your head.

Adorning the walls that stretch above your grasp are various pennants
and banners, as well as some shields and helms prominatly displaying
grandiose heraldry. It is unclear whether these are the booty of past
victories, or gifts of gracious allies.
#
@dig/tel Hall of Battle;room_167
#
@set here/record_id = 167
#
@desc
This room is large and rectangular in shape. The wall surfaces are 
covered with thick woven tapestries which depict past feats of arms
and courage.

Most of the tapestries tell the story of large battles and campaigns
which are now long forgotten by most. The identity of the individuals
depicted is unclear. The "who's" and "why's" of the particular conflicts
shown, however, is unimportant. What is important, is that sword and
sinew met against like, and yet another test of warriors' mettle was
passed.

#
@set here/record_id = 168

@desc
This room is the terminus of what life holds in store for the man who
chooses the way of arms: battle, glory, and death. This room honors
the glory achieved by those of the past. The moment of victory, of 
timultuous triumph and painful loss, is honored here. Fame and glory
is fleeting, but this chamber pays tribute to all the success of arms,
to the instant when victory is fresh, and the dead are still warm 
upon the field of battle.

The room is walled in marble, and the hundreds of small niches carved
into the wall are filled with momentos of past victory, now forgotten.

This small chamber is dusty, and smells of decay. Four closed doorways,
shrouded by a stone arch each, are set in each of the four walls.

A large stone block, some four feet high, has been placed in the center
of this otherwise bare room. Two crossed swords, and a heraldric design
have been carved into the surface of the block.

The grand central staircase on which you stand spirals beyond sight both
above and below you. The seemingly fragile stone steps work their way around
a central chasm. The spiral of steps gets tighter above, and wider below.

There is only a dim light here, but an ornate railing serves to keep you 
from falling to your doom in the darkness.

A small landing is at this point, and warm air enters from a northerly 
passage.

This chamber is large, but bears little decoration or ornamentation of its
own. Instead, it serves as a place to display the products of the forge,
and the skill of the smithy.

Weapons and armor of fabulous manufacture are on permanent display here,
while less esquisite items are arranged in less ceremonious stacks and
piles. A few items of gold and silver are also on display here.

You stand in a large cavern, which is dominated by a forge of unusually
large size. It is here that weapons and armor are made for the warriors,
and here where the great smiths ply their trade.

Several smiths are busily working here at any given time. You notice that
many of them seem to be dwarves. They are totally enraptured in their work,
and are not aware of your presence.

You notice that a shaft has been cut into the ceiling above the forge, and
the hot air currents rise up through it. It is very hot here.

The central floor of this chamber is sunken several feet below the 
level of the corridor. Stone steps, which serve as seats, run up the sides
of this large gallery. The sunken floor is covered with a thick layer
of sand and gravel. Several large torches provide light.

This room serves as a combat arena, where ceremonial battles and 
general competitions are held. Unarmed matches, as well as honor
deuls are all held here. 

The Warlord's place of honor is in the center of the east wall.

Two passages lead out of this room, to the east and to the west. The
stones around the eastern passage are brightly colored, while those
around the western have been tinted with dark hues.

This small room is dominated by a large brass container. The container
is roughly cylindrical, though it bulges out, and has a rounded top.
The top is continuous with the body, and has a small slot cut into
it. The bottom of the container is set into the stone of the floor.

Overcome by curiosity, you try to move the container, which stands
about 5 feet high, but to no avail. It is solidly in place.

what purpose is unknown. 

A few candles provide some dim light, by which you can notice a large
dark smear which is spread over part of the table, a chair, and the

A mat of woven reeds covers the entire floor of this small chamber. An
iron lamp, lit by the burning oil enclosed within, hangs from the 
low ceiling off to one side.

On the south wall has been emblazened the coat of arms of the Warlord.
On top of this has been hung two crossed swords. More ceremonial than
useful, the swords have been secured to prevent theft.

This room is rectangular, and its length stretches out before you to

is flanked by a series of iron braziers in which burn red hot coals.
At the end of the walkway is a stately, high backed seat of stone,
carved into the wall.

Iron rings and shackles are noticeable in the side walls. It is from these
that important slaves and prisoners are displayed for the benefit of
visiting personages.

The western wall of this room has been covered with a huge animal hide,
of unknown origin. Upon the surface of the tanned hide has been drawn
a map of the known world, with the Warlord's Fotress occupying a slightly

map, indicating the broadening visions of conquest entertained by the
Warlord.

Unlike the rest of the fortress, which is stone, iron, and generally
Spartan in attire, this room is plush and luxurious. A thick mammoth
hide carpets the floor, upon which are laid numerous cushions and 
pillows. A reclining chair is here, as well as a rosewood cabinet
which contains an impressive selection of imported spirits. Other
trinkets of value can be seen, while a hint of perfume hangs in the

This place is dark, cold, and damp. The smell of must and decay is 
strong here, and the reason is relatively apparent.

Set into the walls of this rough concourse are many burial shelves,
upon which rest old bones and urns of ash. Most of the shelves are
covered in a white burial shroud of cobwebs. Names have been

in full battle gear lying still. The warriors hands are crossed over
his chest. A groove and appropriate indentations indicate where a

A skeletal figure is positioned in a stone throne against the eastern wall
of this chamber. A large sword, unfortunately rusted beyond use, lies 
across the arms of the throne. The floor has been covered with an iron
grate, beneath which can be seen piles of bones and weapons. Apparently,
the things protected by the iron grate are the bones of those slain by
the deceased personage, accompanied by the booty he may have won. The
glitter and beauty of the objects have faded, and everything is thickly

This small crypt pays homage to a warrior who was apparently much respected
at one time. The actual stone coffin has been interred in a vertical 
fashion, as if the deceased were standing up, and was sunk into the

Into this small cave flows water from the south. In addition, fresh
spring water gurgles up from below. This rush of water is carried
away in a small river leading north out of the cave. The flow
passes through a small opening, unnavigable by humanoid creatures.

This cave is small in floor space, but it has a very high roof. Twisting

You now stand on a steep hillside that is shadowed by the immense bulk of
the mountains rising up to the south. The hillside is littered with boulders
and rocks that have tumbled down from the heights above. Rock walls rise up
to the east and west of here, preventing passage in that direction. A
greener valley, however, lies north of here, down a steep incline.

From where you are, you can see a lone tower rising up out of the 
mountainside. The tower has thick battlements, as well as a spindly turret,
partially obscurred from this vantagepoint, that rises even higher. This
must be the Cliff-face Tower, the window of the Warlord.

road, and prevent travel east or west.

Placed at even intervals are the grim reminders of the Warlord's 
power: the rotting remains of those suffering execution at the command
of the Warlord. Some of the victims have been crucified, while others
were merely left to starve and die in iron cages.

The stench of decay and death fills the air.

The mountains give way at this point to a stunning escarpment. The 
rocky peaks drop in an essentially vertical fashion down to a plain
some several hundred feet below. Where you stand, at the top of the
cliff, the ground is devoid of soil, and is a mixture of marble and
more common stone. 

From this vantage point you can look out over a vast plain of stone,
as well as the gaping pits that lie at the foot of the escarpment. The
mountainous formations at the top of the escarpment prevent you from 
going east or west, but a steep trail leads down to the plain below.

You find yourself at the center of a vast marble quarry. It slowly dawns on
you that this whole gigantic plain of marble is one large quarry, and that
the great mountains to the south were chiseled and broken down to this
level for the sake of the marble here. It is mind boggling to consider the
millions of tons of stone that were removed, and the length of time that
must have been required to accomplish the task.

A wide, deep crevace runs through the marble plain at this point slightly
west of here. Otherwise, the plain of stone runs undisturbed for a great
distance.

You stand on a vast plain of marbled stone. The rock is sometimes 
smooth, and easy to traverse, but often jagged and sharp, cutting your
footware and feet. The lack of shade or shelter on the plain makes any

uneven, with tufts of shrub and other small plant life eaking out an
existance here and there. The whole scene appears as a parched landscape,
as if it has been scorched by a burning sun for ages. Oddly enough,
however, is the chill wind that rakes across the land from the north.

Looking north, you can see glistening snow fields and glaciers, a strange

A bluish tinged sun, low on the horizon, provides blinding illumination
reflected off the ice and snow that is all around you. A strong wind 
causes great, billowing swirls of snow that descend upon you vengefully,
aided by the stinging ice chips kicked up by the chilling forces.

This is the base of the seemingly impossible tower that rises above. The
tower has a slim base, but buttresses and wings that extend into space 
with no apparent support. From the outside of the building, you can see
domes and minarets rising out of spidery wings that extend out in 
right angles. Common sense would dictate that a strong breeze would 
topple this unlikely place, and yet it stands firm without a hint of
sway.

The base is open to the outside, with four slim pillars existing as the
sole foundation for all that towers above.

completely encloses the room.

You are now standing at the bottom of a square shaft. The floor is of

An open passage, and a small landing intersect the shaft to the south. You

The room is a immense, and itself alone would defy the flimsy support of
the tower as seen from outside. A score and more tables, all littered
with glassware and intricate experiments, are arranged thoughout the 
chamber. Here a dark potion bubbles and emits an orange gas, while
there a green liquid hisses with almost human contempt. 

Hanging from the high ceiling is an iron chandelier resplendent with wax 
globules that serve as candles. Under narrow arches, open passages lead
out of this room both to the east and west.

Four stout iron racks are in this room, on which are placed many small

gold. Thick bars are held in place over the rack to prevent theft, and
a large padlock secures the whole apparatus.

A large balance hangs from the ceiling, with a comprehensive set of

This room is small, and has a low ceiling. The walls and ceiling are,
however, plated with silver. The silver coating is without any apparent
seem or gap, and the method of its application eludes you.

The surface of the silver is smooth and without any visible marks, with
the exception of a small corner where some of the silver has apparently
been scraped off. When you touch the wall, you feel a slight warmth, but
it feels slightly strange...as if you are not actually touching the wall
at all.

Huge blocks of iron are stacked in this room. The walls here are of stone
blocks mortared together, and there are no furnishings or other trappings
to be seen. 

Traveling through the room, you find yourself swaying involuntary, as if
you have lost full control of your limbs. It dawns on you that this might
be the result of the magnetic attraction between the huge mass of iron,
and the articles on your person. 

Some of the blocks of iron are soft to the touch, and yield like a sponge.

Wooden shelves and racks line the walls of this room. Glass jars and vials
filled with some mineral fill the shelves. Two large tables with high edges
occupy the center of the room. On one table an intricate apparatus has been
set up, in which some mineral samples are boiled in a liquid. A strong 
smell of sulfur is emitted. The other table holds a yellowish powder.

An alchemists glyph has been carved into the floor of this room.

The sphere rests in the center of the room, and extends to the ceiling
some 20 feet above. There is room to move around the sphere, but only 
barely.

You are suddenly struck with puzzlement. The entrances into this room are
barely large enough for a man, let alone this giant ball of lead. 

An alchemists glyph has been inscribed onto the surface of the sphere.

This room lies in stark contrast with most of the other rooms in this
structure. Every surface of the room is constructed of a black stone.
The stone seems to consciously devour all light, and pulsate with the
digested energy. A candle burns here, but its illumination seems 
hollow and insignificant.

Wide, low steps of the same black stone lead both up and down in front
of you. The air here is completely motionless, as if dead, but you do
feel a slight chill.

Steep, narrow steps lead further up into this improbable structure
from this point. The steps wind over themselves as they climb, and the
steps seem to have sprouted of their own accord from the wall which
they hug.

Looking up, the stairs seem unnaturally steep, almost vertical. At some
points, they even seem to be going upside down.

You stand on a spiraling nightmare of utter blackness and despair. A pallid
light shines from below, but it is devoured without shedding its warmth or
hospitality. 

The steps are wide and low, though it is very difficult to distinguish
them in the darkness. As you walk the steps, you are greeted by silence. 
Even an echo would be welcome. Instead, the dark stone devours the sound
of your passage almost as soon as it is issued. You put your hand to the
smooth stone, but cannot determine is the pulsating sensation you feel is
from the stone or your own pounding heart.

This low roofed chamber is made of the same dark stone as the stairway that
leads up to it. There are no furnishings, as such, here. However, a 
myriad of objects, vials, and cages are strung with leather thongs from
small pegs that have just out from the wall. Occasionally, a small breeze
enters this chamber from the south, causing the hanging objects to clink
and jingle.

This room smells of chemicals, fire, burning flesh, and death.

This room is dominated by a gigantic cauldron of blackened metal. the
cauldron sits partially in a curved pit which has been carved into the
black stone of this room. Like the chamber to the north, this roonm is
made entirely of an eerie black stone, that seems to absorb light, sight,

At this point, a narrow walkway intercepts the staircase from the east.
The walkway is constructed of marble slabs, and is about 5 feet wide. A

You are on a walkway of marble leading through this spacious room. While
you do not wish to attract attention to yourself, you cannnot help but
stare at the scene before you. What can only be described as a demon
is restrained in some sort of magical cage in this chamber. A man in
a heavy cloak stands before the cage, making frantic hand gestures,
accompanied by some non-sensical mumbling. 

Suddenly, the magical cage is burst asunder, and the demon, holding a 
huge flail in one hand, grabs the man, and hauls him kicking and screaming
through a portal to hell.

You stand on a walkway of marble slabs which leads through this

point only the nature of the floor stone delineates the path.

A battle seems to be going on about you between a large, fanged monster
and several warriors. As you watch, the last living warrior is crushed
under the bulk of the beast, which then proceeds to devour the corpse 
greedily. This task done, the creature turns its eyes towards you...
This might be a good time to move along.

point.

On the other side of the railing, to either side of you, you can see robed
figures moving about. Long hoods hide their faces, and they seem to take
little note of you. While all the figures seem to be moving intently on

outside of the walkway, which they do not approach.

gamut of vegetable, mineral, animal, as well as otherwise...

A rickety stool has been placed between the tables, but it is now 
vacant.

The floor here is made of a smooth gray stone, but a stark line of

The floor of this large room is made of a milky white stone, as is the
dome which roofs it. The curved dome is a hemisphere which slopes down
to the floor. The apex of the dome is about sixty feet above the floor.

Hanging from the center of the dome is a small chandelier. The white 
surfaces catch the light favorably, and thus suffficient illumination
is provided from a small source. 

A wide stairway of the same white stone lies in the exact center of this
domed chamber, leading down.

This room is a narrow, long gallery. While devoid of furnishings, it does
hold a few objects which might spark your interest.

Floating in mid air in the room are 6 golden spheres. The spheres are all
of different sizes, and they have been polished to a bright shine. The
spheres' surfaces are smooth, and without any apparent marks.

As you approach one of the spheres, it drifts away out of your reach. The
process is repeated at each try. A slight humming accompanies the high 
speed spinning of the golden globes.

Floating in mid-air here are 7 daggers, of varying size and style. They
flutter and jerk of their own accord. As you approach they seem to sense
your presence, and their motion changes to a more agitated state. Most
of the blades hang point down, but one by one they turn toward you, and 
make threatening dives and swipes. The largest blade is stained with an
ominous crimson tinge.

Carved into the surfaces of the tables is an ornate snake that runs

This room is square, and vary small in floor space. You are puzzled,
however, by the immense, and paradoxical, height of the chamber. This room
alone, already high above the Ashen Plain below, seems as tall as the 
entire structure appeared from below. 

The walls of the room are continuous shelves of books and scrolls. A frail
metal ladder leads up the walls, and a spidery network of catwalks and
ladders allows access to the dizzying heights of the upper reaches.

This room is covered withh a thick, lush, carpet. A small wooden stand has
been placed on the carpet, upon which a book or scroll can be rested. 
Shallow shelves have been carved into the rock of this chamber, and they
are filled with small totems, trinkets, and spellcasting paraphenalia.

Clearly, this room is designed for the casting of spells, and the workings
of magic. The spellcaster can recline on the carpet and read the words of
invoking from the stand.

Orderly rows of tables and desks fill this rectangular room. Dusty volumes
fill a multitude of wall shelves, as well as the desks and tables. A

The faint smell of mustiness is somewhat masked by the odor of burning 
wax and animal fat.

The door into this room was stuck shut, and you get the feeling that
this may be a room that is usually avoided. The interior looks harmless
enough...dusty but mostly bare.

A small light catches your eye. What looks like a glowing lizard scurries
across the floor, only to dissolve upon reaching the far wall. A larger,
less recognizable shape begins to make a similar journey at a slower
pace. When it reaches its destination, it changes in an amorpheous fashion,
and divides into several smaller pieces which flicker and fade.

This chamber is of smallish size and low ceiling. Some tables and chairs
have been placed here in seeming dis-array, as have a wide variety of
everyday objects. 

The flickering candlelight of the room gives the illusion of motion to the
objects here, or so you think until you notice that the candles themselves
are slowly moving towards you. A chair slowly scrapes across the floor, 
while a table jerks into deliberatee motion...all moving inexorably for
you. A brace of sticks begins to quiver with excitement, while a dagger,
glistening in the dim light, begins to hover...

This large room is roofed with a dark dome. Instead of being smooth, the
dome has a "honey-combed" look to it. Small points in the dome sparkle
and glitter, like light reflecting off of gold. There is no apparent
light source here, however, which would provide the necessary incident
illumination.

In the silence of this large darkened room, the glittering dome appears
as the heartful twinkling of a staar-filled night sky.

The thick coating of leaves that seems to be everywhere throughout the

passing, opposed to the usual grumble. The tree trunks and foliage 
glisten with an unnatural perspiration, as if a brisk rainfall had just
past. 

You can remember no rain, however, and even a harsh storm would not
penetrate the wood and leaf roof that is above.

The oppressive bulk of the forest extends right down to the thin, rocky
shore of the lake waters. Outcroppings of rock, the lake waters, and the
forest itself prevent easy passage east or west off the lakeside rocks.
The only egress available is to plunge into the depth of the forest, or
to venture out on the lake. A voice inside you speaks against risking the
unknown darkness of the woods.

This section of the forest is the darkest and most tangled you have yet

forest floor. No undergrowth lives on the ground. In fact, most of the
wooden monsters rooted here are dead or decaying.

The normal sounds of the forest are absent. Instead, a low shuffling
seems to echo your movement through this tangle. Your own sounds are
impossible to conceal as you fight each step through the thick litter
of dead branches and lifeless brambles.

upward. Strangely enough, the floor is smooth and even. 

The path of this passage is fairly straight, with only a minor veer
here and there. There is no wind here, but you are filled with a

This chamber shows signs of stonework and the structure partially

stonework seem to blend together as if they are the fused parts
of a larger organism. Where the ice ends, and the stone begins, is
not clear.

The floor of the room is hard and flat, and is a combination of stone

The roof of this chamber is lower than that to the south, and from it
hang a solid cluster of icicles. The icicles are of great size, 
stretching from the ceiling some fifteen feet above down to the floor.

Passage through this room is difficult as you have to pick your way
through the inversely tapering columns of ice that block your path.

Light filters in from above somewhere, and fills the room with a dull
light amplified by the white iciness of the structures within it.

This room is half filled with salt, which cascades into the room from
above. Smaller trickles lead down through tiny holes in the floor of
this chamber to further hidden places. At first you discard this 
place as nothing more than an uninteresting nuisance. Then you notice 
the objects and other signs of habitation. Then the footprints. 

The broken remains of human weapons are half buried in the white drift
of salt here. You also notice small footprints made in the salt, and not
yet obscured by its motion, tha indicate that someone has recently left
this chamber.

#
@set here/record_id = 276
#
@desc
Tall buildings flank this old alleyway, though they are in the
critical stages of decay. Large blocks of stone have fallen from above,
and the alleyway is largely closed off. Much of the stone on the northern

buildings here.

@dig/tel Guild Forum;room_277
#
@set here/record_id = 277
#
@desc
You stand in a square forum which is faced by the fronts of majestic
looking buildings. The floor of the forum is of marble, and the 
dedication markings which have been inscribed there indicate that 
this place was once the home of the great Guilds of the Realm.

You notice old wires running above the forum between the building 
fronts. It takes you a few minutes to spot the remains of the 
faded tarpualin that could be pulled along the wires to cover the
forum from the elements.

#
@set here/record_id = 278
#
@desc
You stand in the main chamber of one of the Guild houses that has
survived the ravages of time and natural disaster rather well. This
entrance hall is spacious, but rather bare. Some tables remain here,
with some accompaning chairs. A faint rug remains here, though it has
been worn through. A main hallway once led west, but a partial collapse
of that area of the Guild house prevents you from going that way. 
A smaller door has been jarred open to the north, however.

a marble platform.

#
@set here/record_id = 280
#
@desc
This structure was of wood, and long ago burnt to the ground. Blackened
timbers lie amongst the piles of ash that lie here motionless. The lack
of wind has kept the ash and charred remains of the building clumped
here together for ages.

The covering of ash is several feet thick, and dark grey.

@dig/tel Wizard Archives;room_281
#
@set here/record_id = 281

This small chamber is lined with stone racks housing documents and
books, most of which are now crumbling and useless. A central table 
is here, but it has been crushed by a large block of stone which has 
fallen from the ceiling. 

This room lies below the level of the street, and you must climb
down a short set of steps to get into the room, and likewise climb
up to get out.

This wide avenue is flanked by the remains of tall residential 
buildings. The remains of two small fountains can be seen adjacent 
to the street, as well as that of small shops.

You infer that this district may have been used for public festivals
of perhaps celebrations to commemorate some civic event.

@desc
From this vantage point, clear of the buildings, you can observe the
nature of the place in which you walk. In place of the sky, a stark
night of stone greets you. The remains of this place were apparently 
long ago swallowed up by the earth. A vast cavern extends around 
this old city. In some places it appears as if the world of rock 
that lies above was simply dropped down upon an unsuspecting town.

Where you stand in particular appears to have been a park or gathering
field of some sort.

@dig/tel Library of Ancients;room_284
#
@set here/record_id = 284
#
@desc
You stand in a building that clearly was once used as a library.
Unfortunately, it has seen better days. The delicate spiral steps that
once lead up to a second floor have now collapsed, and the books that
adorned the many shelves lie scattered and shredded about the room. 
The damage looks more like the work of a natural disaster and great time
than that of an invading foe or vandal.

Wings of the building once extended off in many directions, but now they
have mostly collapsed, and are impassable.

This must have once served as a study room of some sort. A grand oaken

Curiosity peaked, you begin to thumb through one of the books...only to
have the pages crumble in your hands.

You slowly pick your way amongst the rubble and debris scattered about
as the result of the collapse of the roof and upper floors into this 
wing. 

The remains of what was likely a desk, and perhaps a personal quarters

wood and stone lying on top of it.
#
@dig/tel Sealed Entrance;room_287
#
@set here/record_id = 287
#
@desc
What was once a gate leading out of the city lies here. Like many areas
of the city, the surrounding cavern wall has cut through the existing 
structures, as if the rock was dropped onto the city, or as if the 
city was transported into this void. 

The wooden remains of various riverboats and trading goods can be seen
lying about, as if a river once lied beyond the gate.
#
@dig/tel Cold Anvil;room_288
#
@set here/record_id = 288
#
@desc
You stand in a wide, but low, building. The floor is of dirt, covered
with straw. Benches containing various tools and implements stand idly
about. In the center of the room lies a large anvil, on a base of wood,
which it in turn seated upon a pit of gravel. An ancient forge can be
seen in the corner, that it long ago collapsed in upon itself.
#

This building is short of width, but extends down in front of you for
some way. The room has been floored in wood, and a clutter of 
workbenches and tools lies in the far back. Near the door lie several 
standing wooden racks upon which were displayed suits of armor. 
Many of those still here have decayed into uselessness.

@desc
Thus once majestic Guild has been gutted by fire. The skeletal remains
of upper floors and adjacent buildings can be seen above, but most of
the structures in this area have fallen into a huge pile of ash, charred
timber, and fallen stonework. Near the doorway you find a brass plate,
identifying this as some sort of craftman's guild.
#

@set here/record_id = 291
#
@desc
This chamber is smaller than the entrance hall, and contains many
desks and tables. Clearly this was some sort of school or study
chambers. Books lie on shelves and open on the desks, but every 
attempt to make to examine them resuls in the crumbling destruction
of the documents and pages.
#
@dig/tel Chamber of Splendor;room_292
#
@set here/record_id = 292
#
@desc
This chamber appears rather spacious and exotic. For some reason, the
ravages of time which have afffected some much else of this city, have
left this room untouched. Though abandoned, it looks as if this room 
was only left a few days ago by its occupant. The thought slowly 
strikes you that perhaps this place was not protected from aging, but
that rather all the other places of the city were unnaturally aged
in some form.

By the look of the furniture and trappings of this room, a person of
great influence and power resided here.

@desc
You stand amongst the many white headstones which mark the graves of
those who were buried here unknown centuries ago. The remains of strange
herbs still remain near some of the graves, as do other interesting
items that were apparently offered to the dead, possible the result of
an ancestor worshipping cult.

This was once a place of worship for the now long dead citizens of
this city. The orderly long rows upon rows of seating have been 
disturbed by the collapse of some upper tower of steeple, which 
brought a good section of the roof down with it.

The upper end of the building, where a sacrificial altar of some sort
may have stood, has been buried by the rubble.

Fallen buildings lie on either side of the road here. Only the foundations
of what must have long ago been exquisite villas remain. One of the 
buildings has collapsed into the street, creating a minor obstacle 
which you surmount with minimal difficulty.

As you distance yourself from the center of the city, the structures 
seen to be more intact. It is almost as if some disaster hit the center,
and radiated outward until it died out.

You are on a road which intersects with what may have been some sort
of business district in days gone by. The front faces of tall buildings
flank the narrow road, creating an even eerier setting amongst the strange,
hazy light that is here. Stepping through a random doorway to investigate,
you find nothing but rubble beyond.

A large building lies immediately to your east. It seems largely intact.

You enter a wide building, of which only the first floor remains intact.
Many tables are set up around the room, and racks along the walls hold
scrolls and parchments. You inspect such, and make them out to be
transaction ledgers of some sort. 

Heavy dust has settled on everything, and loose parchments are scattered
about. Some loose coins and money can be seen.

You are on a minor road which is flanked by majestic statues of

days gone bye, and wonder at what has become of them now...

You stand in a small marketplace that lies astride a minor road that
runs north of the ampitheater. The road widens at this point into a 
small square, in which a fountain still stands. A withered old tree
hangs limply over the fountain. 

A large statue once stood here, but it has been toppled and broken.
Chips and pieces of marble lie scattered nearby, intermixed with the
rubble of lesser works.

This room seems remarkably well preserved, if unusual. Once inside the
small doorway, you are greeted by several sprawling stone tables. You
walk over to one to find a crytsal cup still resting upon it. Looking
around, you see curved pillars reaching up towards the ceiling which
is still intact. An iron chandelier hangs down. Spiral patterns can
be seen worked into the stonework on the floor.

You stand at the lip of an oval ampitheater which slopes down in
front of you. The center floor of the ampitheater is of sand.

A slight breeze moves over the open seats and steps, moving the haze
which hangs in the man-made gulley. Amidst the deadly quiet of the 
near darkness you can almost here the roar of a crowd, and the sounds
of those who once were here.

the district. They are backed by the crumbling remains of old buildings.
Behind the buildings to the south you can make out the dark form of

The black steps from above terminate in this dark chamber. The wide 
steps turn into a flat plate of blackness, complemented by the walls
which are of similar nature.

The only light available here comes from a faintly burning candle 
affixed to the wall of a passage leading south. The passage is narrow,
but tall, and is also made of the smooth blocks of black stone.

The vaulted ceiling of this chamber lies above you in a triangular arch,
while the floor is of sand. A spiral pattern has been drawn in the
sand, and has laid undisturbed for many centuries. Small colored
pebbles have been placed at 'significant' places in the pattern.

Light coming from the passage leading north illuminates the room dimly.
The air here is very still.

On the southern wall there is some ancient writing. Look closely to
decipher it's mysteries.
#
@dig/tel Bowels of Monster;room_310
#
@set here/record_id = 310
#

You stand in a large chamber that has been constructed with huge 
blocks of stone. The floor of the chamber is circular, but three
dimensionally, the chamber is tear-drop shaped. The rough blocks 
overhang those of the lower tier slightly, and mortar has not been 
used. The whole chamber reminds you of a structure created from the giant
blocks of a child.

In the center of the chamber, a small flame burns atop a bubbling pool
of some dark liquid.

@desc
The obsidian passage from the north widens only slightly at this point, to
form an oval chamber in whose center lies the round abyss of the Demon's
Shaft. There is another pallid candle here, whose dim light was enough to
prevent you from taking that unknowingly fatal step into the circle of
bottomless black. 

The Demon's Shaft is an exact circle cut through the black stone. The sides
of the shaft are completely smooth, and the lip makes a sharp edge with the
floor. The area around the hole is free of all marks, though a raised 
cylinder of stone, about eight inches high, stands starkly by the dark well.

@dig/tel Low Tunnel;room_313
#
@set here/record_id = 313
#
@desc
This tunnel is wide, but has a very low ceiling, forcing people of human
height to stoop in order to travel through it. Most of the rock surfaces
are rough, and sharp, though the floor has been worn smooth by the 
passage of many feet. It seems clear, however, that this tunnel has not
seen much traffic in recent times.
#
@dig/tel Giant Web;room_314

The tunnel at this point is sealed by a series of giant spider webs. The 
webs are like solid sheets of silky white cloth, finely woven into the 
surface of the rock. The air here is deadly calm, and not a hint of breeze 
disturbs the frail barracades. 

You notice a cut has been made through the webs. Apparently someone has
been this way before...

@dig/tel Forgotten Cave;room_315
#
@set here/record_id = 315
#
@desc
This cavern is large, and was apparently a place of some significance. The
walls of the roughly round chamber have been worked to from a set of low 
steps which probably served as a seating area. A large stone formation 
rises from the center of the room, and is capped with a natural basin.

In the basin is a pool of liquid which burns with a nearly transparent 
flame. Apparently a supply of water tainted with a natural combustive 
liquid is forced up the length of the formation into the basin, causing 
this perpetual flame.

This is a cylindrical cavern. Standing in the center of the cave is a 
large quartz formation. The bottom part of the formation is the same grey
stone of the rest of the cave, but it gradually gives way to a yellowish
quartz.

The quartz takes on a roughly diamond shape is about 5 feet long. When you
touch the cloudy stone, a jolt of scenes rush into the cave, though they
are wispy and clearly an illusion. You see small, fanged, humanoid creatures
the likes of which are unfamiliar to you. They seem very barbaric, but 
the scene is dominated by a sense of remorse and loss.
#
@dig/tel Salt Cave;room_317
#
@set here/record_id = 317
#
@desc
A thick coating of salt crystals covers the floor of this chamber, giving
it a white, wintry appearance. The salt is visible in the walls and roof
of the cave, which also shows signs of humanoid hands. 

The cave seems rather damp, and the air has a taste of salt to it.

You notice salt trickling down several small holes in the floor. The holes
almost have the look of sinkholes. The motion of the salt reminds you of
an hourglass, ticking away the seconds of your life, ticking away to an 
imminent disaster.

This cave appears to have served as a communal garbage heap for eons. 
Layer after layer of filth have been piled up in here in a display 
that is truly awesome, and enough to turn your stomach. The disgust
evoked by the vision is only to be matched by that caused from the 
stench that rises from the huge mound. Decaying flesh, and rot, are
prime among the diverse scents that reach your senses.

A small platform constructed of loose rocks is here. Upon the platform 
is a wooden chair. The chair is ringed by a circle of skulls that have 
been cleaned and polished. 

Some mangy skins and such also complement the room, but there is little
else of consequence. The are signs of fairly recent occupation, and 
something has been chiseled into the floor of the cavern.

This chamber is long, and of low roof. It has the feeling of immense 
age, and looks as if it has not been disturbed in centuries. The room
is mostly empty, whatever treasures might have been stored here are 
now long gone. 

The sole occupant of the chamber is a lonely stone throne. The throne is
richly carved. The more you look at the images depicted there in crude
detail, the more you begin to fear what terrors may lie within these
caverns deep under the mountains. A thick layer of cobwebs shrouds the
regal seat with a sad finality.

You stand in a darkened glade that serves as the center of the surrounding
village. Being underground, no light should be present, but a hazy 
illumination permeates the gigantic cavern which holds the remains of
this village. 

The trees in this area have all died, and some have toppled to the ground.
Small doorways can be seen to the sides, but there is no sign of recent
habitation. Looking up, you notice wooden platforms and complex structures
that have been erected amongst the treetops.

This wide clearing near the center of the village was on open air
market, in which the villagers and visitors must have sold their goods.

Some small trinkets remain, crushed into the dirt, but the surrounding

A long counter runs the length of this room. Behind the counter are many
shelves, while in front of it are rotting sacks and barrels of various

The shelves behind the counter have been smashed, and the contents lie
in a heap of broken merchandise on the floor. A long blood stain
darkens the counter.

This was probably once a place of worship for those who inhabited this
village. It looks as though the people payed homage to some form of forest
deity. 

The temple had no real walls, but tall trees growing side by side formed
an almost solid wooden screen about this sacred place. In the center, 
is what once must have been a truly tremendous tree, judging from the girth
of the silvery trunk that remains. All the trees have been burned from the

A small spring once gurgled to the surface here, surrounded by the

of the vegetation now, however, is blackened stalks and tree-trunks.
A fire must have ravaged through this area, and you wonder if perhaps
that was the reason why this village was left deserted.

You have stumbled across the remains of what must have been a modest,
but quaint, abode in the trees. The trees on which the house was supported
have collapsed under the weight of their burden, and have brought the
structure toppling down to the ground. The house has largely been smashed
into kindling, but ordinary objects such as tables and chairs, have been
spewed out onto the floor of this dead forest.

Just beyond this point to the west lies the black rock wall of the

You stand in the entranceway of a building which has survived whatever
ravages destroyed much of this village. The construction is entirely 
of wood, and from what you can see is very finely done. The architecture
mixes natural beauty with a touch of artistic creativity to create
what must have once been truly stunning. 

From what you can see, this was probably a library of some sort. Wooden
arches extend to the east and west of this room, apparently leading
to other wings. The second level also appears intact.

You are on the second floor of a wooden building which lies at the

the surrounding trees, and is open on the north face. 

Wings of the building once extended to the east and west. The wing to the
west has collapsed entirely, crushing the building directly underneath it.
The wing to the east is in almost as bad a condition, but not quite. You

stack of papers and books were apparently dumped in the center of the 
floor here and set alight. Very little remains to be examined.

Markings, slogans, and exhortations adorn the walls here. By the look
of it they were put here by the villagers. From what you can make out
they are some form of propaganda, instructing the populace to obey
orders and work harder.

#
@set here/record_id = 336
#
@desc
As you step onto the wide branch, it gives way underneath your weight.
For a split second you are in free-fall until the branch catches, and bends,
upon a lower tree. The wood of the branch is dead and rotted, and 
compresses with surprising ease under the wieght of your footsteps.

A small vine serves as a railing here, but if it is in the same condition
as this branch, you would be well advised not to trust your life to it.
#
@dig/tel Shaken Platform;room_337
#
@set here/record_id = 337
#
@desc
This is a wide platform constructed of timbers lashed together. The 
weakness of the dead trees on which the platform rests causes it to
pitch wildly as you step onto it. It repeats this motion as you shift
your wieght and move around.

It is on raised platforms like these that much of the now gone 
populace lived on. The fallen remains of other platforms can be seen
from this vantage point through the hazy light present here in this
huge cavern. A lashing of tree branches forms a roof above you, while
a main trunk continues up through the roof.

@dig/tel Forgotten Room;room_338
#
@set here/record_id = 338

@desc
This chamber sits atop the branch roof of the platform below. It has walls
constructed of wood, and a trap door can be brought down and bolted to
prevent entrance from below. The room is now empty. Its purpose remains
a mystery.
#
@dig/tel Rubble-Choked Wing;room_339
#
@set here/record_id = 339
#
@desc
Large trees from the dead forest surrounding the structure have come
crashing through this area. The roof, and much of the floor, has
collapsed or been ripped away. A large bin can be seen in the far end
of this chamber. Taking a closer look, you notice that the bin contains
numerous vertical slots, into which have been inserted many scrolls.
A quick examination of the scrolls reveals that they were likely of a 
magical sort. However, any magic they once may have held seems to have 
faded with the people who once lived in this place.
#
@dig/tel Thinning Branches;room_340
#
@set here/record_id = 340
#
@desc
Only the dead calm air makes travel over the thin, dead branches of this
area possible. A little wind would send you falling down to the ground below
with a multitude of rotted wood after you.

A tight overlay of dead branches forms a plausible walkway amongst the
trees. In greener times, the view from here was probably quite stunning.
#
@dig/tel Blackened Eaves;room_341
#
@set here/record_id = 341
#
@desc
You find yourself walking gingerly upon a crispy rope bridge that 
connects two platforms. All around you are the blackened tree-tops that
remain as a testiment to some great fire. A clearing has been burnt in the
forest below, but it is difficult to make out any details from here.
#
@dig/tel Crumbling Platform;room_342
#
@set here/record_id = 342
#
@desc
This platform is more steady than the other, but it is no more safe. The
wood of the platform has rotted through, and pieces of it give way wherever
you step. It is impossible to tell what was once here, as fire and decay
have destroyed everything. To the north of here you can see the black
form of the cavern's wall.

You stand in a large underground world, filled with a miraculous 
species of tree. This is but a part of a humongous cavern which 
extends far to the south. Rough igneus rock walls greet you to all
other directions.

The foliage here is now wilted and dead, but you can imagine that the
towering tree trunks that remain, slightly tinted with a silver,
were once wondrous to see.

@desc
This chamber has been crudely burrowed out of the earth, and is 
uneven and without definitive shape. Gathered here is an innumerable
writhing mass of rats. 

The normal rats seem to cower in reverence of a truly huge specimen
of rodenthood. The monster rat is several feet tall, and sports 
a brace of sharp teeth. 
#
@dig/tel Corridor of Stench;room_346
#
@set here/record_id = 346
#
@desc
This passage is square, and all its surfaces are flagged with smooth
stones. Magical stones, which glow with a faint blue light, have been
set into the wall to provide illumination. All attempts to remove these
stones meets with failure.

The corridor is filled with a terrible stench of decay and rot. The 
smell brings to mind a vision of a field of rotting flesh, or rank
upon rank of dead.
#
@dig/tel Rotunda Mortis;room_347
#
@set here/record_id = 347
#
@desc
This chamber is large and circular. The roof is domed, and rises to
a star-shaped piece at the apex. Short corridors, leading to visible
steps lie to the north, east, and south.

The floor here is of smooth stone. The center is covered with a
mosaic depicting the Sun being devoured by some darker diety of
an unknown religion.
#
@dig/tel Steps of Famine;room_348
#
@set here/record_id = 348
#
@desc
A wide set of steps fans out before you, covered in dust and age.
They have the look of crumbling instability, but you are not deterred.

As you begin to walk down, you feel a great hunger gnawing away at you.
The stone of the steps begins to crumble under your weight, throwing
you off balance. Your downward motion is the unsteady, stooped 
progress of one beset with great weakness and infirmity.
#
@dig/tel Steps of Strife;room_349
#
@set here/record_id = 349
#
@desc
The stair that lies before you has steep, narrow steps. The wall is 
jagged, and leans into the pathway which you must travel in order to
descend. As you squirm slowly down the dusty steps, the rock edges
cut at your exposed skin, drawing a minor trickle of blood in a few
places. A feeling of claustrophobia begins to overcome you.
#
@dig/tel Steps of Disease;room_350
#
@set here/record_id = 350
#
@desc
Wide steps lead down a dusty corridor here. A fresco follows on the
accompanying wall. The fresco is faded, and depicts a group of tall
humans afflicted with a form of severe malnutrition. A dark form,
clearly of some distinct caste or existence, moves among the others.

Thick cobwebs cover the steps, and dust floats heavily in the air.
#
@dig/tel Grand Mortuary;room_351
#
@set here/record_id = 351
#
@desc
You find yourself in a large chamber of low ceiling. Some long tables
can be seen as well as some wooden boxes which may very well be coffins
of some sort. This area has the appearance of a mortuary. 

Upon closer examination, the boxes do indeed appear to be coffins, but they
are caked with dirt and mud. Peering inside one, you get the feeling 
that it was once occupied, but is now empty.

There is a faint glowing here which provides light, but it is from an
unknown source.

#
@desc
You find yourself in a long dark passageway. You are forced to feel your
away along in the dark. Your hands move along the smooth walls..which
at first seem very close together, but then diverge. Your hands touch
each wall as it slowly moves away from the other, and yet your arms 
never seem to lift up or lose contact with the surface. 

As you walk along, you feel a slight breeze, and whisps of lighter 
shades of dark move past you. A flickering light appears, and disappears
in the distance far ahead of here. Once the light is gone, you feel as
if you are in even deeper darkness.
#
@dig/tel Flame of Souls;room_354
#
@set here/record_id = 354
#
@desc
This chamber contains an immense wooden throne which appears to have
been sculpted from the ancient, gnarled tree which is behind it. The
tree's branches arch over to form a lofty canopy of golden leaves
above the throne. A few marble pillars stand silently, as if in
testament to the timeless majesty that this chamber embodies.
#
@dig/tel Room of Living Death;room_355
#
@set here/record_id = 355
#
@desc
This room is irregular shaped, and completely carved out of a smokey
white crystal that looks like very cloudy glass. The walls are somewhat
jagged, but the floor and roof are perfectly smooth, flat, and parallel.
A pale light seems to radiate from the floor. Looking down, you can see
mist swirling on the floor. You reach down, but realize that the mist
is actually swirling inside the crystal. While you are enraptured by
this phenomenon, another occurs. A sheet of mist slowly emerges 
from one of the walls, as if its incorperal being is being dragged
out from hiding. It swirls through the air, and appears to be 
pulled back into the opposite wall.
#
@dig/tel Gallery of Hungers;room_356
#
@set here/record_id = 356
#
@desc
You have reached a long, narrow chamber. The walls are covered in rough
tiles of pale earthy colors. The ceiling is high above you, and cannot 
be seen clearly in the darkness. A faint source of light is south,
but the sensation of hunger and weakness slowly grows within you as you
take each step towards it.

A small groove runs down the length of the gallery. It is about an inch
wide, and two inches deep.
#
@dig/tel Chamber of Poisons;room_357

#
@desc
A light fills this chamber, stemming from a fire which burns here.
Slicing through the room is a rivulet of molten rock, which pools in
the center before exiting through the opposite wall. Small flames
dance on the molten rock, and give off noxious vapors which fill the
room. 
#
@dig/tel Place of Deep Misery;room_358
#
@set here/record_id = 358
#
@desc
The floor of this circular chamber is covered in sand. As you step 
into the room, you quickly sink a few feet down into the sand! Buried
underneath the covering of sand are jagged rocks which slice and rip
at your flesh. The pale sand of the room greedily absorbs your blood 
as it is spilled!

Slowly you pull yourself up, and reach a more solid footing. A sense
of great regret and misery fills you, as you look at the sandy 
floor that is capable of devouring so many things, perhaps even your
will and soul.
#
@dig/tel Smoking Mirror;room_359
#
@set here/record_id = 359
#
@desc
A long black mirror covers the northen end of this room. As you 
approach it your reflection seems to fade in and out, while smoke
drifts along the surface of the mirror. As you get closer, you can no
longer see a reflection, only blackness. The smoke almost seems to
be drifting out through the mirror. Reaching out, you touch the dark
glass, and are comforted to find it firm and solid. 

An angular pattern has been made with the colored floor tiles here.
Light enters the room from the south.

@desc
This dark cave appears to have once been a secret entrance into
deeper caves. The tunnels farther back from the riverbed have been
blocked by rock and other rubble, apparently barring all passage.
The remaining chamber in which you stand is circular, and rough, with
a trio of carved pillars rising up. The pillars, upon closer
examination, have been carved to represent humanoid figures whose
faces are contorted in expressions of extreme pain or rage.

A walled pool of dark liquid is here. The liquid is very still and 
torpid. You approach the pool and stir the waters with your weapon.
The waters respond sluggishly, and quickly return to a state of inactivity.

The floor of this chamber is a tile mosaic, depicting a large jaguar.
The colors are faded, but were once bright.

The floor of this chamber appears to be of a hardened clay. Drawn into
the clay is a complicated design and motiff, which itself is dominated
by a large eye. Writing of an unknown language runs along the edge of the
floor near the wall.

The walls are smooth, and of a very non-pourous stone. 
#
@dig/tel Cold Basement;room_363
#
@set here/record_id = 363

You find yourself in a basement. The basement is walled with a collection
of mortared rocks, but possesses a dirt floor. You notice that there
are some bone fragments scattered about. You also see tracks in the
dirt floor. The tracks are obscured, as if a heavy object was being 
dragged, and lead from the steps to the center of the basement.

It is very cold here.

The walls of this room angle inward, while the floor is concave. A mat

wooden bowl. Woven into the mat is a design crudely depicting a 
bird. 

The wall is covered with red markings and crude paintings which
depict a withered field and gaunt livestock.

The stench of decay is very strong here, overpowering and sickening 
you as it fills your nostrils. Sprawled out before you is a corpse
of untold age. Yet despite such, it remains in a state of continual
rot and decomposition. Considering the age of the surroundings, nothing
should be left of the body except bone fragments. Yet, the corpse 
looks as it is has only been dead a few weeks.

This room is cold and dark, being unlit by any recognizable means. The 
wall and ceiling surfaces show a rather rough finish, but the floor
has been chiseled smooth. Straight lines have been carved deep into the
floor, however, and they progress from each of the four corners and walls
towards a small circle in the center of this square room.

As you approach the carved circle, and begin to hear a faint noise, like
water rushing over smooth rocks. As you reach, and touch, the circle,
your vision is flooded with color, as streams of energy flow from the walls
down the lines, and into your body.

You stand in an open courtyard which is shaded by the high walls

From here you can enjoy the view of the city rooftops and follow the

In the distant west the temple district can be seen and the dome of
the fearful Chaos Cathedral. 
The great gate and old wall that kept enemies of old from breaching
Tai-Tastigon lie to the north, with the great plains and forests 
stretching out beyond them.

If you strain your eyes, you may catch a glimpse of a river running
through the south of the city.

@dig/tel Chaos Cathedral;room_378
#
@set here/record_id = 378
#
@desc
You stand in a cathedral of truly unusual design, and nature. The walls
all seem to be of different heights, and whats more, of different
proportions. Walls meet, and yet, it doesn't appear that they should.
An aisle runs lengthwise down this central portion of the cathedral,
but its positioning seems to change with each glance. The more you
stare at things, the more they seem to change, and the sense of
motion begins to make you feel ill.

The cathedral is topped with a dome is darkened glass. While the sky was
dry from outside, the dome seems to be enduring a rough rainfall.

Standing on a flat marble surface is the altar of the cathedral. Like
many of things here, its form undergoes change. At one moment, it 
seems solid and impressive, the next it is a molten blob of 
liquid metal. By its transmutations, the whole altar seems to defy
reality, and mock the concept of truth. It is unsettling for you 
to watch the altar for any length of time.

This long, narrow section of the cathedral is filled with the fanfare
of Chaos, emanating from an unknown source. Accompaning the music
is a fast moving swirl of colors that obscurs, or perhaps is, the
ceiling of this section of the cathedral. The dressings and curtains
here sway as if from a strong wind, but you can feel no breeze.

@dig/tel Cathedral Dome;room_381

You stand on a narrow ledge on the inside of the cathedral dome. The
dome is constructed of subsequent tiers of adjacent metal and stone
arches. The lowest tier of arches is open, and allows passage to
the outside ledge surrounding the dome. The upper portions of the dome
are covered in dark glass. Unlike the view from below, the dome when
seen up close seems rather ordinary and solid.

A series of interconnected and adjacent rooftops lies to the south, 
while to the east you can see the upper stories of the Res Ab'tyrr,
the main inn of the city.

A frail stone buttress, severly weathered by the elements, connects 
the upper sections of the Res Ab'tyrr to the dome of the Chaos

You are upon a narrow street which is walled with odd, and downright
peculiar, buildings. The building faces come right up to the street,
and tower down over those walking by. These buildings are the places

The rooftops in this part of the city are very close together, allowing
quick passage across them, faster than travel on the streets below.

A decent stretch of glistening white beach lies here, backed by a 
high rock wall. The beach gradually slopes down into the Ocean, as
it is pelted by wave after wave. 

The sun gleams off the waves in the distance, and a cool breeze

You find yourself on a thin stretch of shoreline which hugs the high
cliffs rising behind you. A faint trail can be followed to the north,
which slowly winds its way up to higher ground. The cliffs extend 
around to the east, and are an impassable obstacle there.

Looking south across the Ocean, you see endless waves and the blue 
of the sea. A comfortable breeze drifts in from the Ocean, and the
sound of the waves crashing against the cliffs to the east fills you
with awe.

Among the lower peaks of the mountains, this pass is one of the few

The air here is thin, but crisp, and the view is astonishing.

Far to the west you can see the mist shrouded shape of the Great

The wintry landscape that lies all about you is dominated now by the
jutting mountains of ice that are thrust up from the snowy earth. To the 
north lies a particularly impressive wall of solid ice. A peculiar, dark
shape lies near the base of the glacier.

To the west are rough, and impassable, glaciers. While the wind has died
down, it is still terribly cold here.

You stand at the base of a giant wall of ice. You can now see that the
dark shape viewed from afar is actually a structure frozen in the 
glacier. 

In front of you is a large gate, leading into what appears to be a 
palace of some sort frozen into the glacier. The gates have a large,
and somewhat unnatural, keyhole in them. You try to open the gates, but
they are apparently frozen tightly shut.

The Res Ab'tyrr is the finest inn in Tai-Tastigon. It is a large building
painted with intricate designs. It has a fine reputation for both food
and board, and it is located in one of the nicer areas of the city.
However, the Res Ab'tyrrs' fame springs from the whimsical good luck

You have stumbled into the macabre happenings of the charnel house of

is strong here, as well as the smell of the perfumes used to hide
the stench of death and decay.

The structure is currently empty, as far as you can tell, of live

A few flickering torches illuminate this chamber, which appears to

You have ventured onto an island that bears the appearance of a ship

the room. It leads upwards toward a door of ivory that has been
left ajar.

There are no windows and the walls are covered with tapestries

Like the land to the north, this place seems to be absent of color,
existing in a half-way world of black and white. Your sense of
depth-perception seems to be failing you, and strange shadows can be
seen where there are no objects to project them. 

The sun is hidden from the clouds, and a perpetual twilight exists.
Occasionally you see what appear to be walking shades. What substance
these shadows are made of is unknown, for you are fearful to approach

This wide plain was once the site of a battle between the forces of 
darkness and those of light. While the outcome has been obscured by the
passages of time, and the frail memory of Man, this land has been
forever scarred by the forces and tradgedy unleashed here.

Bone fragments still litter the brown grass that fills the plain, and you
smell a rotting scent. A low, squat tower of dark stone sits lonely upon
the plain to the east.

A tight path leads up into the mountains.  Once blocked, by massive fallen

the valleys.

This chamber is octagonal. Each of the walls is plated with a blackened,
rusting iron. If legend is to be believed, the implements of war were
melted down after the battle to create this chamber. 

In the center of the room lies an oblong chunk of a dark crystal. The
crystal is about 6 feet in length, and a couple feet wide. You attempt
to move it, but it refuses to budge. While you watch, a shadow of 
blackness moves across the room, and enters the crystal, turning it a
shade blacker.

You stand atop a wind swept bluff which overlooks a deep gorge. The 
bluff is a craggy outcropping, with a sparse covering of grass. Across
the gorge to the west you can see the impressive shapes of the the 
Ebonbane Mountains. You wonder what sights could be seen amongst 
those fabled peaks, but you know of no way to reach them.

A reddish light fills the western sky as the sun sets, a brilliant 
triumph of color and hope amidst a dark and desolate landscape.

The landscape here is rocky, and dotted with brown grasses and various
scrub plants. Dark clouds block much of the sun's light, and a strange
twilight exists here. The only color evident in any quantity besides
gray is a dull brown. This is not so much the character of this place,
but rather the influence of the nearby Haunted Lands. To the south,
signs of travel and habitation by humans is visible, but most avoid 
this border with the Haunted Lands.

This cavern is dominated by a large, sluggish pool. The pool is very 
dark, and looks almost like a tar pit. The color is not black, however,
it is crimson.

The pool is said to be the blood collected from those captured by the

The cave is rather narrow, and low of room. Running down the center of

end of the room, but widens to nearly the full width of the chamber at
the east end. It is here that Troll warriors test their courage by
jumping across the chasm, daring others at attempt a more dangerous

Iron stakes have been driven into the floor around the skeleton. Each 
stake is topped with a partial skeleton, likely human.

Clay pots, which have been sealed with a wax, or possibly fat, have

@dig/tel Carpeted Concourse;room_472
#
@set here/record_id = 472
#
@desc
This long hallway beyond the golden doors is lavishly carpeted, and
decorated with trappings of various sorts. Paintings and statues 
line the corridor as if standing in salute of your passage.

An old man can be seen in a small niche in the wall. As you approach
he says to you "I will give you a key to get beyond the door at the
end of this corridor...just because I like you."

#
@dig/tel Lair of the Beast;room_475
#
@set here/record_id = 475
#
@desc
This room is the lair of the Beastie, who has gotten a much worse
reputation than he deserves. He is actually quite friendly and
talkative. 

The Beastie sits atop a huge pile of cushions, and is busily devouring
an antelope. He politely stops eating as you enter, and nods in your
direction.

[The Beastie may divulge the password out of this chamber if you
ask him properly by mentioning the correct keyword.] (demonlord)
#
@dig/tel Long Tunnel;room_476
#
@set here/record_id = 476
#
@desc
You are standing in a long tunnel, which is only dimly lit. You 
follow it along to the east, but it ends in what appears to be 
a dead end. 

Looking down you see a shiny object.

[Hint: pick up the object and examine it.]
#
@dig/tel Street of Ribbons;room_477
#
@set here/record_id = 477
#
@desc

of the street. Stone idols sit along street and watch the passerby's
with their dark eyes.

#
@dig/tel Introverted Chamber;room_479
#
@set here/record_id = 479
#
@desc
This round chamber is where you must examine your inner being, and
determine is you are ready to enter the world of both beauty and 
violence that lies beyond this small area. The chamber is round, and
free of trappings. there is nothing here which might distract one's
attention away from the necessary introspection. 

[Hint: Check your stats]
#
@dig/tel Gold Alley;room_480
#
@set here/record_id = 480
#
@desc
This part of the city is quiet and relatively deserted. The buildings
surrounding you proclaim that this was once the location of the Gold
Guild but it has long since been abandoned.
Residents of the city occupy the dark buildings. For some reason, this
is not a popular place to live..
#
@dig/tel Shining court;room_481
#
@set here/record_id = 481
#
@desc
This area once housed the famed jewelry courts and guilds of gold
and silver. The prosperous guilds have moved their quarters to other
parts of the realm leaving the shining courts empty. Little travel
comes through these quiet streets now.
#
@dig/tel The Rim;room_482
#
@set here/record_id = 482
#
@desc
You have reached the rim of the city. This is the old wall of inner
defences that once stood against enemy hordes from the east. It has
been abandoned in these more prosperous times.
#
@dig/tel Sun Gate;room_483
#
@set here/record_id = 483
#
@desc
You stand at the eastern sun gate of Tai-Tastigon. This was once a
great thoroughfare, the caravan grounds for travelling merchants
beyond the great wall. 
All is desolate now...
The caravan grounds now house the dead..
No one passes through here these days except for the spirits of the
departed.

@dig/tel The treasure room;room_497
#
@set here/record_id = 497
#
@desc
This chamber is of moderate size, and is oval in shape. A series of
murals runs along the smooth walls, depicting great battles of heroes
long past.

A small gutter runs along the edge of the room, and it is filled with a
burning oil of somesort, which highlights the murals, and fills the
room with a slightly oily scent. In the center of the room, a huge
crescent moon has been carved into the rocky floor.

@dig/tel Rickety Stairs;room_500
#

You stand on a long spiral of wooden steps that lead farther down below
the temple. The sides of the steps are open, and if you are not careful
you could have a nasty fall.

#
@set here/record_id = 501
#
@set here/trap_chance = 35
#
@set here/trap_to = 6
#
@desc
You find yourself in a bed of thick seaweed, which floats up around
you obscuring your vision. You feel a slight buoyancy, but are otherwise
none the worse for wear, considering you are meanding around at the
bottom of a lake. The water here is a bit muddy.

The seaweed sways back and forth slightly with the slight current of
the lake, induced by the Wyrmraggen River.
#
@dig/tel Watery Cave;room_502
#
@set here/record_id = 502
#
@desc
A large cavern, completely filled with water, encloses you as you
wander from the open, if murky, waters to the west into this area.
The cave walls are very irregular, creating a distorting image
when coupled with the natural bending of light rays by the water.
The whole cavern seems to shake gently up and down with the motion
of the currents that can be felt even here, tugging gently at you.

The cavern walls become smoother to the south, where additional chambers
might lay.
#
@dig/tel Aqua Steps;room_503
#
@set here/record_id = 503
#
@desc
Low, smooth steps spread out before you. The steps are colored a bright
aqua, and seem to radiate a faint glow. The wide stair leads upward
to another chamber.

About halfway up the steps is a shimmering barrier. After taking a few
steps towards it, you finally realize it to be an air pocket of some
sort. Because of the ease with which you have been moving about in 
the magical lake, you have almost forgotten that you were under
water at all.
#
@dig/tel Glistening Columns;room_504
#
@set here/record_id = 504
#
@desc
This is a most peculiar chamber. It is roughly circular, with walls a
dull color similar to those of the steps which lead up to here. In the
center of the room are several colums which bow and curve noticeably
as they move from a thick base through a slender trunk and again to
a bulky union withh the chamber ceiling above. 

The colums appear to be covered in glistening scales of blue and gold,
which shimmer and twitch as if the scales of a living fish..
#
@dig/tel Room of Shells;room_505
#
@set here/record_id = 505
#
@desc
This chamber is relatively small compared with the one to the west. The
entire visible surface of the room is covered in a colorful mosaic 
comprised of thousands of tiny shells. 

Staring at the floor and ceiling, you lose yourself in sweeping patterns
of swirls and spirals. The colors seem to appeal to your emotions, and
are very soothing.
#
@dig/tel Coral Doorway;room_506
#
@set here/record_id = 506
#
@desc
You find yourself at a solid wall of gleaming white coral, intersprersed
with highlights of red. The rock adjacent to the coral wall is dark and
featureless.

Upon examining the coral wall, you notice an almost imperceptable seem
which runs down the center. The shell-like crustaceans you thought were
decorative now appear to cover hinges upon which the large doors of coral
might swing open upon. 
#
@dig/tel Coral Chamber;room_507
#
@set here/record_id = 507
#
@desc
Compared to the dim tones and lighting of the other chambers of this 
area, this room booms out at you in a brilliant fanfare of gleaming
white coral. You stagger under the initial brightness, but slowly
adjust to it enough in order to peer around.

The chamber is very large, and made entirely of white coral. The room
is bare except for a gigantic shell which rests in the center of the 
chamber. The shell has been subtlely carved into a throne of immense
size.
#
@dig/tel Sinking Passage;room_508
#
@set here/record_id = 508
#
@desc
The air in this passage is very damp, and the stony floor is covered
with a thin layer of sand. The passage slopes downward noticeably.
#
@dig/tel Whirlpool Bottom;room_509
#
@set here/record_id = 509
#
@desc
You stand in a round chamber of stone which has no ceiling. Instead,
a gigantic whirlpool of water spins above you, threatening to crush
your pitiful existence. Through some feat of magic, the violent
waters do not reach down into this chamber, held back by an unforseen
force.

The room itself is damp and bare.
#
@dig/tel Elemental Crossroads;room_510
#
@set here/record_id = 510
#
@desc
You find yourself in a sparsely lit, but well decorated room. All aspects
of the room seem perfectly normal, except for strange murals on each of
the walls. Each wall depicts some form of natural force in action. The 
north wall shows a scene of great winds laying low towering cities. The
east wall depicts a hurricane in the process of flooding out an entire
coastline. The south wall details a scene of thousands of creatures being
totally consumed by a raging fire. Finally, the west wall shows a scene
where great mountain ranges are being pushed up out of the earth's crust.
Also, the murals seem to strangely flicker, as if they were alive. One last
point of interest is a large plaque that has been embedded in the floor.
#
@dig/tel Arlindel's Testimony;room_511
#
@set here/record_id = 511
#
@desc
This room is very sparsely furnished. In fact, the only furnishing in the
entire room is a solitary table. The table seems to serve as some sort of
display, as on top of the table is a book which has been left open. You
cannot touch the table or the book, however, and each attempt to do so 
results in a stinging sensation in your hand. You also notice that the walls
of the room are covered with murals, or at least, what USED to be murals.
Paint has been splattered on the walls and prevents you from seeing what 
was once there.
#
@dig/tel Hall of Sleet;room_512
#
@set here/record_id = 512
#
@desc
Immediately upon entering this room, you are hit by an onslaught of sleet!
The sleet comes nearly straight down on you, and upon looking around, you
can find no place to shelter yourself from the freakish weather. When you
look up, you can just barely see the ceiling of the huge hall, but more
than that, you DON'T see any clouds or anything else that might be causing
the downpour of sleet. The sleet seems to materialize from out of nowhere.
#
@dig/tel Frozen Caverns;room_513
#
@set here/record_id = 513
#
@desc
Upon entering this room, you notice a marked decrease in temperature. Upon
looking around, you don't find that so surprising, as the entire cavern is
covered with ice. The ice seems to be several feet thick except on the floor
where there is just a very thin sheet of ice that is safe enough to walk on.
With the exception of the ice, the cavern is completely empty.
#
@dig/tel Liquid Caverns;room_514
#
@set here/record_id = 514
#
@desc
This cavern seems to be some sort of aquarium. On either side of you the
walls have been replaced by water, and swimming through the water are various
forms of aquatic life. Upon closer inspection, you discover that there is
nothing preventing the water from flooding the cavern! None the less, the 
water stays in its place, giving you a safe, yet scenic, passage through
the cavern.
#
@dig/tel Boiling Caverns;room_515
#
@set here/record_id = 515
#
@desc
You find yourself in a completely empty cavern. However, the cavern is not
totally devoid of interest, as it seems as if the very walls of the cavern
were boiling! In fact, one would be hard pressed to come up with a better
description of what you see before you. It is not entirely unlike standing
in the middle of a bubble, with the exception of the solid rock floor that
you are currently standing on. You can now feel the heat coming off of the
boiling walls, but the heat is only strong enough to cause you some slight
discomfort, not any real physical harm.
#
@dig/tel Wystryk Memorial;room_516
#
@set here/record_id = 516
#
@desc
Upon entering this room, you are immediately stunned by the sheer beauty
of the scene before your eyes. Majestic fountains abound throughout the
whole room, and great sheets of water, like giant waterfalls, fall down
along the entire length and height of the walls. The fountains are magically
lit by some unseen light source, and each has its own color of the rainbow.
The waterfalls are similarly lit, except that the light changes in both
intensity and in its color in a somewhat irregular fashion. Standing all 
alone in the middle of the room is a statue of a man dressed in what seems
to be the robes of a wizard. You can just see that there is some writing
on the base of the statue.
#
@dig/tel Hall of Steam;room_517
#
@set here/record_id = 517
#
@desc
Upon entering the room, you can't help but notice the sudden increase
in humidity. However, the rise in humidity as not surprising, considering
that the room seems to be filled with steam. While searches for the source
of the steam prove unfruitful, you still determine that the steam is 
replenished somehow, as the steam never dissipates, and the temperature
of the room never drops. It doesn't take long until your clothes are soaked
through, from head to toe. Water (or sweat) streams down your face, as the
steam bath begins to take its full effect on you.
#
@dig/tel Trail of Heat;room_518
#
@set here/record_id = 518
#
@desc
The walls of this long, but cramped, chamber are made of smooth stones
which glow dimly. The waves of heat they send out suck the air from
your lungs, and crush you under the wieght of your own load. Shimmering
lines of heat are visible here, as moisture is rapidly pulled from your
body. The path through the room appears the safest way through the chamber,
as to move near the walls is to invite damage.
#
@dig/tel Trail of Blazes;room_519
#
@set here/record_id = 519
#
@desc
Moving along the trail you are greeted here by dancing flames, and
flickering lights. Long shadows are cast oddly against all the walls
as you try and make your way through past the unbearable heat.

Sweat trickles down your brow, and you are near unconsciousness...
#
@dig/tel Trail of Cinders;room_520
#
@set here/record_id = 520
#
@desc
The darkened chamber is lit by the dim glow from hot cinders which
line the single path through the room. The smell of fire and smoke
reaches your nostrils as you survey your surroundings. Occassionally
a burnign ember drifts up on a slight breeze and floats across your
path, but if you stay on the trail you should remain free of injury.
#
@dig/tel Tomb of Fastigonn;room_521
#
@set here/record_id = 521
#
@desc
This stately chamber apparently houses the remains of a personage of
some importance. Narrow columns run up the walls, supporting a ceiling
that is detailed with a picture of a great city basking in brilliant
sunlight. At the center of the chamber is a narrow, but very tall
sarcophagus of black stone. Placed atop this strange item is a disk
of gleaming brass. Some words can be seen on the black stone.
#
@dig/tel Hall of Smoke;room_522
#
@set here/record_id = 522
#
@desc
Thick, acrid smoke fills this room. At first you try to bend low beneath
it, but this smoke clings tightly to the floor, smothering you in its
weight. At length you notice a narrow passage through the haze towards
the far exit. It seems to be the sole escape from the choking morass
which clogs your lungs.
#
@dig/tel Magma Path;room_523
#
@set here/record_id = 523
#
@desc
Suddenly, you find yourself in the middle of an immense lava flow! You cannot
see any end to the molten rock, as the flow spreads out to the horizons.
Strangly, however, the lava seems to totally avoid the narrow path which you
are on. So, for the meantime, you are presently safe. There seems to be no
source of the magma flow, as there is not one volcano in sight. However, the
flow shows no sign of ceasing.
#
@dig/tel Earthen Path;room_524
#
@set here/record_id = 524
#
@desc
It is hard to concentrate on anything in this "room" as everthing in it is
in constant motion. It is equally difficult to descibe what you see before
you except maybe by the phrase, "Standing in the middle of an avalanche",
only because that is exactly what it seems like. There is falling rock
everywhere, except for a small path through the middle of all the chaos,
which the rocks seem to magically avoid. It is impossible to determine
where the rocks are coming from, nor can you see where they are going.
All you can tell is that the rocks don't seem to be piling up anywhere.
Also, with the exception of the path, there is no evidence of a floor
anywhere, nor is there any ceiling or walls.
#
@dig/tel Desert Path;room_525
#
@set here/record_id = 525
#
@desc
Suddenly, you find yourself standing in the middle of a desert! Sand swirls
around in large sand storms, and sand dunes can be seen for miles! However,
it doesn't seem to be too hot, as one would expect with any desert. You also
notice a small path through the middle of all the sand. It is devoid of any
trace of the desert around it and seems very safe. You currently find 
yourself in the middle of the path and thanks the Gods for it, as the sand
storms just off of the path seem pretty nasty.
#
@dig/tel Shrine of Exomerol;room_526
#
@set here/record_id = 526
#
@desc
This room has nothing in it whatsoever, just a dirt floor and walls which
were carved right out of the rock. However the walls are covered from
floor to ceiling with murals of some sort. They seem to have been painted
directly on the rough, rocky walls. Upon further inspection of the room,
you also discover a small bronze plate embedded in the west wall. It appears
to have something inscribed on it.
#
@dig/tel Hall of Dust;room_527
#
@set here/record_id = 527
#
@desc
You find yourself standing in a grand hall, the likes of something one would
see in a royal palace, but seems somewhat out of its proper place in its
current environment. The one odd thing about this whole hall is that
everything is covered by a one-inch layer of dust. The dust even seems to
hang suspended in the air, making breathing a little uncomfortable.
#
@dig/tel Corridor of Smog;room_528
#
@set here/record_id = 528
#
@desc
Heavy, damp smog hangs thick in this chamber, obscuring your vision,
and making breathing difficult. Through the dark haze you can
see the murals on the wall, which depict sprawling cities. You cannot
tell wether the clouds that hang low over the cities are an element
of the mural, or rather just an influence of the gases residing in
this chamber itself.
#
@dig/tel Corridor of Wind;room_529
#
@set here/record_id = 529
#
@desc
Strong winds buffet you as you attempt to work yourway through this
chamber. A faint path is inscribed on the stone floor, leading
towards the opposite exit. Beyond the path the winds seem stronger.

The walls here are deep grey in color, though all attempts at
decoration seem to have been worn off by the unusual winds that
move through here.
#
@dig/tel Corridor of Storms;room_530
#
@set here/record_id = 530
#
@desc
The walls of the corridor you now find yourself in perspire with
moisture, as the air here is exceedingly damp. A brisk breeze
whistles through the hallway, ruffling your clothes.

Crude murals adorn the walls, damaged by the moisture. They depict
violent storms ravaging a small village.

The breeze is stronger to the west.

Lose rocks are all along this passage.  The top of the Mountian is within
sight.  From here you can see all along the forest.  The entrance to the city

easily broken apart, as it appears some force already crushed the rocks.
The hillside is steep enough to slow acsent, which is possible only because
of the well worn path up the hill.

This circular chamber has been lovingly carved out of the surrounding

onyx, infused with veins of gold. The dome is richly carved to
depict beings of a supernatural nature.

This chamber is a large natural cavern that has been slightly worked
by Dwarven hands. Large veins of silver streak across the ceiling,
and similar spidery threads adorn the walls and floor. In the center
of the room, a large silver anvil stands alone. It has been richly
carved, and seems more symbolic than functional.

Strange forces tug at you as you stand is this quiet cavern of ice.
The walls of the cavern are sheer sheets of ice, in which images seem
to move. Visions of ages past are reflected back at you as you feel the
ebb of the tides of time. Tenatively, you touch the walls...they are solid.

You stand a stranger in a place where time has little meaning, alone
with the weight of the past bearing down upon you.

In the center of the cavern is a low pedestal.

You are suspended in a small pocket of still air at the center of a
vast whirpool of water. You can sense a light source from somewhere
above, but can discern very little otherwise. The water swirls about
you at an incredible rate, churning the brilliant blue water into
white foam near the center of the whirpool.

Far below you is a small haven of solid ground.

You find yourself before an awesome, if mind-boggling sight. To the south
rises a towering wall of water, which stretches east and west as far as
you can see. No barriers serve to hold the water up...it stands immobile
as if of its own accord, forming the gigantic wall before you.

As you turn around to survey your position, you are greeted by another
stunning occurance. All around you the shifting sands of the desert 
retreat before you as if blown by ferocious winds. They leave behind
a chasm of immense breadth and depth. You are trapped now before the
walls of water and the infinite chasm...

You stand at the top of a steep path that leads up from the lowlands
into the foothills of the Ebonbane Mountains. From this vantage you
can see the white expanse of the northern lowlands spread out before
you. To the south, on the other hand, lie the darker peaks of the

some fallen warrior, and indicates the beginning of the Path of Shadows.

Darkness surrounds you as you stand before a single silvery path of
light that leads off into the distance. You can feel that this place
has its own dark inhabitants, and that they do not approve of
visitors. It is here to which the Tuatha de Danaan have retreated
from mankind, and where they live in dark solitude.

The silver strand of light leads north from this place, towards a
faraway fire. You find that by mere thought you can move yourself
through this dark landscape.

A great fire burns here, in the darkness. It sheds light, but little
warmth upon the cold void of dreams. You are drawn towards the
flame by a sudden desire, drawn by a faint wavering sound that is
almost, but not quite, human.

You now recognize that this place is an abode of Lugh. Looking inside
the flame you can see the wavering image of the object of your desire.
All you need do is reach out and take it...

This chamber is the shape of a pentegram, and is of dark, but not black,
stone. The roof is low, but slopes into a slight dome in the center.
At the center of the chamber is a bronze brazier in which burns a pale
flame. In the center of the flame you can see a thin ring of metal.

A faint mist clings to the walls here, moving slightly as if animated,
but never leaving the surface of the rock. It watches, and waits...

No sounds can be heard here, it is quiet; as quiet as death itself.

It differs, however, in its shape. This chamber is long and rectangular.

In the center of the chamber lies a rectangular pool of molten metal. A

This natural cavern shaped almost like a cone, with the small end
at the floor, as the walls slope outward as they go up.

The rock of the chamber is very odd as well, in that it is a dark blue.
The tinting of the rock changes with position creating a strange

progressively lighter further up the wall.

The floor of this chamber has been leveled and tiled in marble, while

In the center of the chamber lies a huge stone, almost like a gem. The
stone is of very deep blue, and seems to give off a cool light. You
approach the stone, and peer into its depths, and see a swirling mist

your thoughts.

Along the mountain side, you stumble upon a cave. Covered by thicket, and

A old wooden sign lies upon the floor, covered with weeds, and half rotten.
Bones of humans and other creatures are scattered about the floor.

This chamber is circular, and has a very high ceiling. In the center of
the room is a 12 foot tall statue of the jackle-headed god Anubis. As
a result of some complicated and unseen feat of optics and construction,
a single ray of light shines down upon the statue from above, its
origin unseen. 

It is likely that the builders of this pyramid might have made 
offerings to Anubis in this place in return for his protection of the
souls interred in this great pyramid.

proclamation of whose chamber this is. 

The stone and construction of this chamber differs from that of the

huge blocks of dark stone, and provides the first physical barrier
to the advance of the sea.

Set into this huge wall at the point where the tunnel encounters it is
a doorway. The door is as high as the tunnel, and looks very solid. The
stonework in which the door is set has been delicately carved, and some
words have been inscribed there.

ceiling is domed, but not very high. The floor appears to be of a
single slab of stone. A thin vein of gold runs through this slab, starting
at the walls and spiralling gradually inward in a way that is too
concentric to be natural.

In the center of the chamber is a huge stone table, which is round in
shape. The table bears no discernable markings. There are no further
furnishings or decorations.

At the top of the tower, you see the neatly formed battlement of the fortress.
Peering out over the fortress, you see the great Ebonbane mountains, and the
darkness of the forest surrounding them.
#
@dig/tel Valley Floor;room_705
#
@set here/record_id = 705
#
@desc
Deep down the mountain side, you stumble upon a sparkling brook with trees
covering the floor of the mountain. Paths leading in three directions are
easily found.  The brook runs east and west along side the path, and is 
crystal clear.  
#

Trees are starting to break out from here.  In the distance to the west,
one can see and old fortress standing out above some downed trees.
The sparkling brook from Valley floor makes a turn here to the north, and
disappears into the forest.
#
@dig/tel Steep Embankment;room_707
#
@set here/record_id = 707
#
@desc
From the top of this embankment, a vast field of flowers and grass can be seen
but to get there, one has to travel down the embankment.  It can be done, but
it looks as though it will be hard to negotiate.
#
@dig/tel Fortress Meadow;room_708
#
@set here/record_id = 708
#
@desc
Vast fields of grass surround a large half-destroyed fortress.
Old rusted swords, and shield clutter parts of the field, in remeberance
of battles that took place in this field.  A stone wall in the distance
surrounds the fortress as a barrier.
#
@dig/tel Forgotten fortress;room_709
#
@set here/record_id = 709

This large field of grass stands before a fortess in ruins.  The fortress sits
towards the northeast in the field.  A moat covered with algea surrounds the
fortress making the only possible entrance at the drawbridge.
#
@dig/tel Burnt Hills;room_710
#
@set here/record_id = 710
#
@desc
Recent fires have raged through here, destroying every living thing.  A few
sprouts of weeds and grass can be seen springing up to bring new life into
these hills.  The ground is still pretty hot, the fire must have been very
recent.  Rocks crumble on the slightest pressure from ones foot, from the
immense heat raging once through the land.
#
@dig/tel Black Hills;room_711
#
@set here/record_id = 711
#
@desc
Seeing that the chared remains of animals and trees are darker here, one can
presume that this is probably where the great fire started.  Certain death
would become anyone who was in the at the time of the fire.  Ashes still float
in the air, making it difficult to both see and breathe.  Of what you can
smell, is of charred flesh and hair from once living creatures of a great
forest.

You are in a wide cobbled plaza, dominated by a statue of a warrior
seated atop a rearing stallion. An inscription adorns the statue
base, but has been weathered so severely that it is hard to read.
Some old stone buildings line this rather dark square.

A single great oil lamp hangs down from the ceiling here to provide a
smoky, oily globe of light. It sways gently back and forth, driven
by some unseen force. The floor here is of marble, and a mosaic
depicting a large flame has been inlaid beneath the swinging lamp.

#
@set here/record_id = 717
#
@desc
You find yourself in a semi-circular room with a single large
window facing south. This room is midway up a tower overlooking the
courtyard, but how you can reach the top of the tower eludes you.
The floor is marked with rays of red reaching out from the
north door to the edges of the semi-circle.

#
@dig/tel Hidden Hallway;room_718
#
@set here/record_id = 718

You stand in a narrow, rather cramped, hallway of dark stone. The
stone is very cold to the touch, and does feel quite right.

#
@dig/tel Forlorn Altar;room_719
#
@set here/record_id = 719
#
@desc
The room you stand in is lit by some unknown source. A large circle of black
stone faces upright in the middle of the room, a ring of elder glyphs cut
into the stone around an avellan cross. Thongs possibly designed to tie
wrists and ankles are situated at likely spots on the disk of black marble.
Opposite the stone altar is a black circular mirror, reflecting what little
light there is in this room.

Misty tendrils stream down from the circle of black glass high above like
spiderwebs, seeming to undulate into and out of the black mirror. Something
seems to move inside the writhing mass of darkness.
#
@dig/tel Tower of Yslsl;room_720
#
@set here/record_id = 720
#
@desc
You stand in the lower hall of a solid, circular tower. It rises up
almost a hundred feet, and you can scale the heights from the inside
by following the stone steps which wind about its circumference.
The tower has no windows, aperatures, or other adornments upon its
smooth features, and has been constructed of giant blocks of stone
which appear immune to the effects of time.

#
@dig/tel Upper Yslsl Tower;room_721
#
@set here/record_id = 721
#
@desc
Winds howl over the lofty battlements above you as you look up
towards a pale sky. The height of the surrounding stone prevents
you from seeing the city around you, and despite your height above
the ground, you feel as though you are imprisoned in a deep well.

#
@set here/record_id = 725
#
@desc
This circular room is dominated by a long table of black oak. High
backed chairs flank the table, and an iron lamp hangs down from
above. Overall, the appearance of this room is more stately than
mysterious, placing this area in sharp contrast with the rest of
the tower.
#
@dig/tel Wood-King's Throne;room_726
#
@set here/record_id = 726
#
@desc
This chamber contains an immense wooden throne which appears to have
been sculpted from the ancient, gnarled tree which is behind it. The
tree's branches arch over to form a lofty canopy of golden leaves
above the throne. A few marble pillars stand silently, as if in
testament to the timeless majesty that this chamber embodies.

This oval room is dominated by a very large crystalline mirror which
is fitted into the southern wall. The rest of the chamber is bare.
When you look into the mirror, you begin to see parts of your past,
as well as your own thoughts and beliefs. Obviously this is a very
magical item.
#
@dig/tel Autumnfire Chambers;room_729
#
@set here/record_id = 729
#
@desc
This area is more brightly illuminated than the rest of the tower,
and is dominated by a stunning mural of of an autumn sunset as
seen through the colored leaves of a stand of trees. The floor here
is of marble, but it appears as though fall leaves of red, orange,
yellow, and brown are trapped or frozen just under the surface
of the stone.

Laden in Holy symbols, and white cloth. This room served as the church to the

Mosaics of Gods, and the land cover the floors, and stained glass windows
diffuse the colorful light into this chamber.

A tall throne cast in gold trim, with fabulous velor stands in the back
