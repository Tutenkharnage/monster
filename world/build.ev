@dig/tel Great Hall;room_id_1
#
@desc
This is the first room of many in the Realm of Monster. Once things get 
rolling, a simple series of rooms will be installed which will force
new players to get used to the Monster commands in order to reach the 
actual world. For now however, we will be cheesey, and merely deposit
you in the Realm at a convenient location. 

[Please note: The cheesey shortcut has finally been circumvented. We
will keep the above description however, because we like it so much.]
#
@dig/tel Void;room_id_2
#
@desc
Your life essence is being recycled. Please wait a moment while most
of your previous short-comings are filtered out, and a suitable
replacement body is manufactured.
#
@dig/tel Red street;room_id_3
#
@desc
Residents of the city call out their windows and exchange pleasantries
over you head. Ribbons hang from some of the buildings and you see
they become more varied and clustered further east.
#
@dig/tel Sewer Entrance;room_id_4
#
@desc
You stand at the entrance to the vast sewer system located beneath the
City of Tai-Tastigon. Sprawling out in all directions, the sewers lay
like the web of a giant spider - or like the maze of some deranged minotaur.
The stench here is not as foul as you might at first have guessed, and your
nose quickly adapts to the malorific odor.
#
@dig/tel Tu'matei Alras;room_id_5
#
@desc
You are in the shaded land of soft color in which the Fair Folk
reside to escape the troubles of the mortal world.

Rest well, and do not be troubled by mortal cares.
#
@dig/tel grey hills;room_id_6
#
@desc
The air is cold and stale here. You can still see the City and that
is a great comfort in this cheerless land. Ashes swirl around you,
blown in from the dark east.

It would be very easy to lose oneself here.
#
@dig/tel grey hills;room_id_7
#
@desc
Cries of horror now wind their way through the hills. Perchance
there has been murder here. Travellers must be wary of haunts
that seek for living flesh.
#
@dig/tel wasteland;room_id_8
#
@desc
There is little life here. The crust of the land is thin and all
sorts of loathesome creatures make their home here.

#
@dig/tel grey hills;room_id_9
#
@desc
You have lost sight of the city but there is something that looks like
a dwelling further among the hills. It is quickly growing dark and
it might be a good idea to investigate another time..
#
@dig/tel Circle of Fire;room_id_10
#
@dig/tel Goblin Mural Room;room_id_11
#
@desc
The south wall of this chamber is long, and has been artificially 
flattened and smoothed. The rest of the chamber has been left in its
rough, natural state. The south wall is decorated with a crude, and
disturbing, mural.

The mural depicts stocky humanoid creatures laying waste to a human 
village, underneath a blood red moon. Fires burn in the background, and
scenes of extreme violence are prominantly displayed in the foreground.
#
@dig/tel Pit of Fire;room_id_12
#
@desc
You may alter your pitiful existence in this portion of the Netherworld.
Considering how much time you spend here, it might be an advisable
course of action.

#
@dig/tel The Stone Circle;room_id_13
#
@desc
A multitude of gigantic, dark hued stones are arranged in a circular 
pattern here. Concentric with this arrangement is one of smaller blue
stones. At the very center of the pattern, the ground has been covered
with marble tiles.

This stunning display stands on a mound of solid ground rising out of
the surrounding swamp. A feeling of immense natural power pervades the
entire area.
#
@dig/tel Marsh;room_id_14
#
@desc
A strange mist hugs the surface of the marsh waters, filling you wish
a strong feeling of dread.

The marsh is roughly chest-deep, but dangerous sink holes and drop-offs
abound, making all progress slow to a painful crawl.
#
@dig/tel Fens;room_id_15
#
@desc
Despite the waist deep muck you are now forced to wade through, the
population of trees has thinned only slightly. Tall, dark trees rise
up from the dark mud and water. The trunks of these trees are unusually
smooth, and glisten with moisture as if they were a living, amphibian 
skin.
#
@dig/tel Swamp;room_id_16
#
@desc
You are in a swamp.

#
@dig/tel Great Bog;room_id_17
#
@desc
More so here than in any other area of the swamp or forest, you feel 
as though you are in immediate peril. The mist and swamp gas swirl as
if to purposely confuse you. The strange voice of the wind seems to
speak to you of the unyielding embrace of death that waits for you at 
the abyss bottom of a hidden bog or sink hole. Your mind screams with
fear, and your limbs are reluctant to follow your commands, for fear of
making the tragic mis-step that can only lead to a suffocating doom.
#
@dig/tel Row of Megaliths;room_id_18
#
@desc
An ancient footpath runs from the clearing to the north, south to the
circle of stones. Astride the path are a series of giant megaliths placed
at evenly spaced intervals.

The megaliths are carved from single blocks of a dark stone. Reaching a
height of 15 feet, the impassionate faces carved onto the rock surfaces
stare down upon travellers with indifference.
#
@dig/tel Swampy Forest;room_id_19
#
@desc
The ground here is composed of a muddy slush thickly covered with old 
leaves. The forest is once again dense, and absent of all but the faintest
slivers of light creeping through the leafy canopy. With every step you
take you sink to your knees, and must struggle to free yourself from the
persistant grasp of the amorpheous earth.
#
@dig/tel Cedar Forest;room_id_20
#
@desc
You are finding it hard to determine distance and time this deep in the
forest. The unending multitude presents a constant aspect to you, defying
your senses. A thin mist floats through the forest, only adding to your
apprehension.
#
@dig/tel Cyprus Trees;room_id_21
#
@desc
Twisted cyprus trees rise up here, intertwining in a sinister display.
A seemingly continuous palisade of cyprus trees runs north to south,
complicating any attempted passage to the west.

The sounds of the forest can be heard here, but to the west are noises
of an unknown nature. You wonder if it would not be better to avoid 
the dark tangle of woods that lies west of here.
#
@dig/tel Endless Forest;room_id_22
#
@dig/tel Grey Steppe;room_id_23
#
@desc
The grey lands before you contradict the promise of the sun gate...
they are grey and unwelcome. The eastern lands were once a thriving
market but now restless spirits have taken over the land. The hills
are now hollow, lost souls breaking out from beneath the crust of the
rotton land.

Nothing stays dead here for long..
#
@dig/tel Entrance Hall;room_id_24
#
@desc
A vast chamber of ice surrounds you, encompassing you in a giant tomb
of cold darkness. The walls of the chamber tier inward towards the
ceiling, and appear to have been painstakingly carved by magical hands.

From somewhere far, far above, a thin beam of light enters this 
towering crevace, and is reflected and scattered from surface to 
surface. The ice absorbs the light somewhat, giving back a deep blue
hue that speaks of natural wonders un-beholden to Mankind.
#
@dig/tel Redwood Forest;room_id_25
#
@desc
Lurching up like a wooden mountain here are giant redwood trees. The
reddish trunks are of impressive circumference, and rise straight up to
an incredible height. Even the Great Oaks are dwarfed by these monsters,
though the redwoods do not exude the same aura.

The ground here is bare, for the most part. The giant trees are seperated 
by large distances, providing a relief from the claustrophobic confines 
of the inner forest.
#
@dig/tel Great Redwood;room_id_26
#
@desc
A lone tree is immense proportions towers towards the sky here. Its
gigantic roots ripple beneath the ground like some predator fish
caught at the surface of a frozen lake. Its base is as wide around
as a tower, and its rough bark nearly as tough as stone.

Bits of leaves drift down from above like a faint snowfall, and even
though no other trees can grow so close to this monster, the forest
here is dark and forboding.

#
@dig/tel Forest Crossroads;room_id_27
#
@desc
The trees thin out here, allowing a small clearing that shows signs of
traffic. Unlike most of the Great Forest, light streams down upon you 
here, and smaller brushes and foliage flourish.

Ancient stones of immense size can be seen to the south of here, while 
the steady sounds of a slow moving, but mighty, river can be heard to
the west.
#
@dig/tel smoking ruins;room_id_28
#
@dig/tel Barrow Mound;room_id_29
#
@desc
Rising up in an exposed fashion, unsheltered from the protective forest,
is a group of grassy mounds. These are ancient barrow mounds, holding the
remains and treasures of personages long forgotten by all except the Druids.

The barrows are apparently roofed in wood and stone, and covered with earth.
The largest of the mounds exudes a feeling of extreme age, and has fallen
prey to the effects of erosion. Large blocks of solid stone are visible.
While you might be able to pry one loose, and venture into the blackness
of the ancient grave, your better judgement tells you that such actions
might be unwise.
#
@dig/tel Keep Entrance;room_id_30
#
@dig/tel foyer;room_id_31
#
@dig/tel Hall of Honor;room_id_32
#
@desc
In the dim light you can see the walls of the great hall of covered
in tapestries, now tattered and burned and difficult to read. What
you can see of the stories told therein are confusing, giving little
information as to whom the inhabitants of this place were. Or how they
died..

Set within the walls are three doorways, each with an inscription in
faded letters above.

The words speak of danger and death.
#
@dig/tel World Window;room_id_33
#
@dig/tel Troll Tunnel;room_id_34
#
@desc
This tunnel is quite large, as if made for the passage of creatures 
much larger than that of a human. The bottom tunnel surface is flat,
while the top is arched.

The tunnel has been rough-hewn, and is unlit. You can feel your way 
through without much difficulty however.
#
@dig/tel Dark of the Moon;room_id_35

@dig/tel Starless Night;room_id_36
#
@dig/tel Defeat and Dishonor;room_id_37
#
@dig/tel tomb of Darkmage;room_id_38
#
@desc
You arrive at the tomb of Darkmage, the wizard.  An eerie silence hangs in
the air.  A light breeze sends an occassional chill through your body.  The
tomb itself is a large concrete structure, simply crafted in a Gothic style.
Stairs lead up to a huge set of double doors.  The doors themselves have no
handles.  
The cemetery road extends east and west from here, splitting around the
tomb itself.  There are small gates along the north and south edges of the
road, separating the tomb area from the cemetery proper.
All is silent.
*Very* silent.
#
@dig/tel sewer1;room_id_39
#
@dig/tel War Dance;room_id_40
#
@desc
You have entered a room devoted solely to the arts of war, magical and
otherwise. The room is bare of any furnishing or design and is dominated
by 4 exits that lead from the four walls on the points of the compass.

#
@dig/tel Gaping Pit of Doom;room_id_41
#
@desc
A sputtering torch provides thankful light at this point. The tunnel 
widens out, and you are faced with a large, black hole that seems to 
devour the tunnel, and drag it down into the hidden depths below. 

The dark pit facing you is rough edged, and probably not made by
humanoid hands. You should be able to make a descent.
#
@dig/tel Doom Pit Bottom;room_id_42
#
@desc
You stand at the bottom of a black pit. The skeletons of small animals
who have fallen into the pit and died can be seen scattered about. 

A small hole has been knocked in the eastern wall of the pit bottom. The
hole is large enough for you to crawl through comfortably, and could 
accomodate a larger creature as well.
#
@dig/tel Cave of Mangled Elf;room_id_43
#
@desc
Lying near the center of this cave is the body of a humanoid creature.
It is difficult to tell exactly what race it is from, as it has been 
horribly beaten and disfigured, not to mention partially decayed.

The still form has been manacled to an iron ring set in the floor of
the chamber. Bloody tracks on the floor show the body was dragged in
from the west and has not moved since being chained here. It is 
therefore likely that the body was chained here after death. Perhaps
this is a warning?
#
@dig/tel Cave of Skinned Man;room_id_44
#
@desc
Carefully positioned in the center of the this cave are the remains of
a man. The body has been skinned skillfully, and has been laid in a spread
eagle position. A 'U' shaped iron bar has been pounded into the rock 
floor around the chest of the body, pinning the torso tightly to the floor.

It occurs to you that instead of being a warning, this might actually
be a marker laid for the benefit of those who might inhabit these
caves. You shudder to think of what kind of beings would leave a skinned
body as a path marker.
#
@dig/tel Cave of Eaten Dwarf;room_id_45
#
@desc
Another grisly marker has been left here. This time it is a Dwarf, whose
legs have been gnawed off. An iron spike has been driven directly 
through the body. It dawns on you that these means of restraint are 
likely employed to keep wild creatures from removing the path markers.
#
@dig/tel Fire Leaping;room_id_46
#
@desc
You are in a fiery warm room that glows with the power of flame
that erupts from the bowels of the earth. All around you flames
seem to flicker on the edge of your vision, tantalizing you with
sights of riches never before known.
#
@dig/tel Cave of Violated Pig;room_id_47
#
@desc
A very large lance has been driven lengthwise through the body of a wild
pig here. The lance has been thrust into the cavern floor, upending 
the poor animal, and suspending it upside down. A large pool of dried 
blood has collected at the base of the weapon.
#
@dig/tel Grand Troll Cavern;room_id_48
#
@desc
This cavern is very large, and is strewn with large rocks that have 
been slightly chiseled, and serve as chairs. Three deep fire pits, 
ringed with stones, are situated throughout the chamber. A large 
mammoth tusk and a rough iron bell are suspended from a wooden 
superstructure in the north end of the room. The bell has no clapper,
but is instead rung by swinging the tusk into it.

Near the bell are some stone steps which lead up to a throne carved into
a giant boulder.
#
@dig/tel Confusing Passages;room_id_49
#
@dig/tel Twisted Tunnels;room_id_50
#
@dig/tel Archive Basement;room_id_51
#
@desc
Several large racks run the length of this room. Each of the racks
is filled with scrolls, books, and animal hides. Markings indicate
that the scolls and such are kept in some mysterious order. A quick
examination indicates that the writings are in a variety of languages.
#
@dig/tel Mead Hall Basement;room_id_52
#
@desc
This room is cluttered with wooden kegs and sacks of vegetables and fruit.
There is very little space to maneouver, but a path has been cleared 
from the stairs to the western portal. 

Sounds of singing and revelry drift down the stairs from above.
#
@dig/tel Lugh's Hall;room_id_53
#
@dig/tel Victory Stone;room_id_54
#
@dig/tel Wellspring of Ulster;room_id_55
#
@desc
The walls of this room are timber and stone, while the floor has largely
been covered with smooth stones obtained from a riverbed. In the
center of the floor is a large, clear spring. 

A large root disrupts the stone patttern on the floor as it travels
from a room to the west towards the spring. 
#
@dig/tel Bhalge Beltaine;room_id_56
#
@desc
The walls of this room are rough-hewn, while the floor is smooth blocks
of polished stone. The floor has been covered with symbols, glyphs, and
lines, some clearly indicating constellations. Small holes have been 
sunk from the surface somewhere down into the walls and ceiling of this
room. Through some of the holes, light from the sun, or moon, strikes
the floor markings.

It is here that the passage of seasons and time is observed. 
#
@dig/tel Lake Bottom;room_id_57
#
@desc
The lake bottom does not look like you would expect. Instead of being
rough and uneven, it is regular and flat, as if the floor has been
constructed of stone by some immense, forgotten giant. Small plants
grow on the bottom, and a wide variety of fish can be seen. They do 
not seem to notice you as you stand here, completely out of your
element.
#
@dig/tel Ancient City Square;room_id_58
#
@desc
You stand on a wide cobble plain from which narrow roads radiate out
in the cardinal directions. Once cluttered with arches and columns, this
square now contains only their crumbled remains. 

Though far underground, a hazy light fills the area of the city. The air
is still, and has a mineral flavor to it. The only sound you can here is
that of your echoing footsteps.
#
@dig/tel Collapsed Gate;room_id_59
#
@desc
A great gate, what was once a primary entrance into the city, lies
before you. Its top crossmember is a gigantic single piece of stone,
which has cracked and fallen, like an animal whose back has broken.

Just beyond the gateway lies the rough rock of the cavern wall. The
gateway, however, is filled with rubble and debris, blocking any 
regress.
#
@dig/tel Via Necromantia;room_id_60
#
@desc
You find yourself walking along what must have been the main road of this
ancient city. It is wider than most, but the buildings that line the road
come up right to the edge of the avenue. The buildings are still standing
along the road, which is more than what can be said for much of the city.

The condition of the remains improves to the west.

The center is calm but the outer edges of the room swirl in a
maelstorm that seems never to end.
#
@dig/tel Valleyside;room_id_64
#
@desc
The slope of the hillside, makes traveling much difficult.  The light is
diffused through the tall trees, causing a dim, but visible enviroment.
#
@dig/tel Earth Moving;room_id_65
#
@desc
This room is one of peace and of life, representative of living things
as well as the destructive forces of nature now held at bay. It is
a dark room, lit only by stones that are set in the wall and glow
with an earthy light. The floor is clay and lichens grow along the
walls over stones and soil. In the center of the room is a stone
dais with a book opened and chained to the floor upon it.
#
@dig/tel Riverbank;room_id_66
#
@dig/tel Overgrown Trail;room_id_67
#
@desc
The branches that overhang the pathway are particularly low at this
point. They seem almost animated as they reach towards you and clutch at
your belongings and person. Only the faintest breath of wind aids their
motion.

The trail seems to widen somewhat to the west.

#
@dig/tel Overgrown Trail;room_id_68
#
@desc
This brush chocked trail is reminiscent of a cave tunnel. Ancient trees
hug the pathway, and cover you with a low roof of wooden boughs. The light
that does filter down is dim, and more than a little surreal.

A thick coating of old leaves covers the ground, and announces your passage
with a muffled voice.

#
@dig/tel Great Oaks;room_id_69
#
@desc
Here lies the border to the great forests of the Druids. A nearly solid
wall of towering oaks lies west. A trail leads into a small, cave-like
break in the tree front.

This is a stark demarcation. West lie dark wilds accompanied by the 
sounds of its fierce denizens. East are the meadows and roads of a more
cultivated environ. The break in the treeline at the trail lies west. 
One moment it looks inviting, but the next it seems to mock you with a
tempting and forbodingly silent laughter.
#
@dig/tel Forum of Shops;room_id_70
#
@desc
Thin columns rise up to greet the hazy air here. Marble steps lead 
up and down around various areas that once were home to many shops.
Small bronze statues still stand on pedstals here, depicting 
personages long forgotten by Mankind.
#
@dig/tel Water Flowing;room_id_71
#
@desc
You are overwhelmed by the spirit of water flowing through this room.
The walls are blue and green and seem to be moving, the pale fronds
of seaweed and water grass swaying in a nonexistant tide.

In the center of the room upon a small dais is a book bound in
pale leather, its pages opened and anchored.
#
@dig/tel Pyramid;room_id_72
#

This is the first chamber in the interior of the pyramid. Because it
has remained open to the elements for countless ages, whatever 
stories might have been concealed in this room have been erased by
time and the elements.

@dig/tel Central Fountain;room_id_75

You are in the center of the square by a large marble fountain spraying
cool, clean water.
From this vantage you can see the whole square with its vegetable stalls
and markets where one might purchase a great variety of items.

#
@dig/tel The Mercy Seat;room_id_76
#
@desc
You stand at the far wall of a busy market center stretching to all sides.
Beside you is a stone throne of some sort, stained with what could be dried
blood. This is the Mercy seat where judgement is dispensed in Tai-tastigon.
You notice that despite the busy nature of the square, this area remains
empty...

There is a small tattered piece of paper stuck to the stone seat
beside you...
Apparently the leavings of a former victim.
#
@dig/tel Armory Stall;room_id_77
#
@desc
You stand before a stall displaying many types of light armory. On the
table in front of you animal skins and leather jerkins lay in the
shade of the striped canvas. Wooden shields lay piled in the corner
and you can see an attractive horned helm in a prominent position
among the goods.

#
@dig/tel Freak Street;room_id_78
#

Many exotic items are displayed on this side of the square. Upon the
bright woven cloths totems from obscure religions rest with jeweled
belts from far-away lands. Herbs and drugs designed to induce trances
and visions mingle with ginger and nutmeg.

#
@dig/tel Sucking Vortex;room_id_79

This is the place where you are sucked from the quasi-real dimension
of where you are, through a swirling time-dimension vortex, to the place
where you will be afterwards...the Realm!
#
@dig/tel Temple of Apollo;room_id_80
#
@desc
You have entered the columned structure of the Temple of Apollo. The 
long center of the structure faces a bronze statue of the god. Most
of the temple is open to the elements, as the roof contains a large
opening, but the statue is shaded. A small fountain is beside the
statue. Metaphysical thinkers, as well as worshippers, often come 
here to contemplate the world, and bask in the glory of the sun god.
Priests can be seen moving about the Temple. Occassionallythey venture
to the rear of the temple, which is barred to normal patrons.
#
@dig/tel Shadowed Hills;room_id_81
#
@desc
You are in a region of low, rolling hills. Vegetation and grasses abound,
but they seem to lack any sense of color. The landscape around you seems
cloaked in hues of gray. 

Looking up, you can see the sun, but it too seems to have only a faint
hint of yellow to outshine the substance of gray.

A wall of dark clouds lies low on the horizon to the south.
#
@dig/tel Feast of Corpses;room_id_82
#
@desc
A grisly sight greets you here, where the tunnel widens slightly.
Human remains, obviously very old but surprisingly well preserved,
have been dragged into the center of the passage, where they are
feasted upon by a horde of malevolent rats. The rats hungrily 
devour what remains of the rotted flesh, turning only occassionally
to glance at you. The sound their feasting makes is terrifying...
#
@dig/tel Burrowed Tunnel;room_id_83
#
@desc
You stand in a tunnnel which has been roughly burrowed into the earth.
Loose dirt occasionally falls in clumps, and you are struck by a 
severe claustrophibic feeling, as if the fragile passage might 
collapse in on you at any time. 

It is unclear whether this place was used as a crude catacomb, or 
whether it was merely burrowed through a heavily used grave yard.
In any event, human and humanoid remains push through the walls 
of the tunnel at several levels. The bones are evidently very old,
but some of the remains have been preserved remarkably well.

#
@dig/tel Vegetable Market;room_id_86
#
@desc
This corner of the square is devoted to fresh vegetables and fruit that

You stand amidst a sweeping area of meadows and fresh air. Just to the
west of you looms the treeline of the Great Forest, Aldheorte.

To the north and east loom the stark shapes of the Ebonbane Mountains.
Between these two gigantic entities, this quaint patch of serenity
seems dwarfed to insignificance.

A faint road, more like a dusty path, leads eastward and quickly up
the steep slopes of the nearby hills.

You are standing in a damp, forested gulley that runs north and south.
To the west is the rocky wall of the gulley, which appears extremely
difficult to scale. The ground slopes downward slightly to the north.

The trees on the banks of the gulley lean inward, as if to topple over
and crush you with their dying embrace. The darkness here is very thick,
and strange shuffling noises can be heard from time to time.

Jagged rock walls rise abruptly out of the forest before you. You stand
at the damp bottom of a forested ravine. The cliffs to your north and
south are insurmountable without additional assistance and equipment.

A dark cave leads north into the face of the mountains. The cave mouth
has been carved and decorated with strange and grotesque faces and
beings. The usual sounds of the forest cannot be heard in this place.
You wonder if the savage beings depicted truly exist in the darkness
beyond.

As you pass through the tall iron doors into the courtyard, you see an old

@desc
This squat stone building off the Emporium market is always dark and
smoky. Cloaked or robed figures can be seen lurking around the
various wares, conducting their business with the wizened Arkinor
with just glances, nods, and subtle hand gestures. Strange smells
greet you, and you feel ill at ease thinking about what some of
the items for sale here might be used for.

@dig/tel Forest Lake;room_id_104
#
@desc
The lake upon which you float is fairly calm. Its dark blue waters 
indicate considerable, perhaps unnatural, depth. The lake is surrounded
on all edges by a green border of forest.

Peering into the lake, it seems as if the water below the surface is
moving quite rapidly. Swirls and streaks of color accompany this
phenomenon. Truly, you think, this is no ordinary lake...

@dig/tel Oak Archway;room_id_107
#
@desc
Just inside the gates of the palace grow two oak trees seperated by a 
distance of about five feet. The trees mark the ends of the north and 
south ramparts, and all traffic through the main gate is funneled under
the arch formed by the interlocking branches of the two magestic trees.

#
@dig/tel Grande Mead Hall;room_id_108
#
@desc
This room is roughly square, and has a high, vaulted ceiling. A wooden
doorway is set in the center of each wall.

The interior of the room is cluttered with tables and people. It is here
that a weary traveler can slake his thirst, and hear the songs of the 
bards as they tell of advantures, great deeds, and heroes long past.
#
@dig/tel Earthen Tower Base;room_id_109
#
@desc
You stand inside the base of a tower constructed of stone, earth, and
wooden timbers. The floor is earthen, and packed hard by many years of
use. Timbers hold back the weight of earth outside the walls, and have
been decoratively carved withh strange symbols. The roof is open to 
the second floor, and thus the elements. An iron lamp hangs down from
the rafters near the wall.
#
@dig/tel Tower of Vapors;room_id_110
#
@desc
In the center of this room is a fire, and a large stack of red-hot stones.
A mechanical contraption of mysterious working keeps a continuous stream
of water trickling down onto the rocks to be vaporized. 

Each rock has a unique glyph carved into its surface, which stands out 
in brilliant white to contrast with the red of the surface. It is 
apparent that more than just ordinary steam is rising from the rocks.
Strange colors seem to appear, disappear, and float in the rising 
column of steam that travels upward through the iron grate that serves
as a ceiling.
#
@dig/tel Earthen Tower;room_id_111
#
@desc
You stand atop a tower of earth, wood, and stone. The ramparts known
as the Celtivirke run south and west from this corner tower.
This level of the tower is floored with wooden planks, but an opening
has been cut in the center, revealing the tower interior below. 

From this vantage point, you can look out across the lake and forests,
and even see the mountains to the northeast.
#
@dig/tel the Celtivirke;room_id_112
#
@desc
You stand atop the fortified rampart that runs the perimeter of the Druid
Palace. The rampart is made of earth, wood, and some stonework, as is most of
the entire Palace.

Brisk winds rush over you, and bring the scent of the forest and swamp to your
nostrils.
#
@dig/tel Tower of Vapors;room_id_113
#
@desc
This tower is completely closed, and without windows. The ceiling is very
low, and the interior walls are faced with stone.

Thick mist and steam fill the room, reflected by the low ceiling. The
temperature here is very high, and the humidity is almost unbearable.
The vapors seem to be rising from the floor...you suddenly notice that
the floor is actually a metal grate, allowing steam to rise from below.
Due to the poor lighting, and thick steam, you are unable to see into
the room below.
#
@dig/tel Emerald Concourse;room_id_114
#
@desc
Many of the Halls and chambers of the Druid Palace were constructed as
seperate buildings. This large concourse was constructed to connect
them all, and enclose the entire Palace.

This irregular structure exhibits a thatched roof, and a floor that is
partially hardwood, and partially stone flagging.
#
@dig/tel The Taig;room_id_115
#
@desc
This grand hall is the court of the Druid Emperor. The floor of the hall
is about two feet higher than the rest of the Palace grounds, requiring
one to step up into the room. The floor itself is parqueyed wood that has
been given a high shine. All the doors into this hall are large, wooden,
double doors bound in iron. 

A dark wood throne, enriched with exquisite carvings, rests facing the
eastern door. A large semi-circle has been inscribed into the floor in
front of the throne, with a gold disc inlaid at the center of the 
spine.
#
@dig/tel Room of the Tree;room_id_116
#
@desc
Growing into, or out of, the western wall of this room is an oak of wide
girth. You quickly come to the conclusion, however, that this is no
ordinary tree, as one half is burning in a blaze of flames, while the
other half flourishes in green, leafy splendor.

The flames have a greenish tint, and crackle vigorously, but the tree
is not consumed, and the hall not harmed. 

You notice that the tree seems to be growing out of the floor of this
room as well as the wall.
#
@dig/tel the Celtivirke;room_id_117
#

You stand atop the fortified rampart that runs the perimeter of the Druid

the entire Palace.

Brisk winds rush over you, and bring the scent of the forest and swamp to your
nostrils.
#
@dig/tel Flame Pinnacle;room_id_118
#
@desc
This area is more aptly described as a junction of the ramparts. A small
palisade runs along its corner, but it otherwise has no walls or
distinguishing partitions. 

At the center of the juncture is a raised platform of stone upon which
sits a large bronze brazier. In the brazier burns a greenish flame that
is apparently unaffected by the winds. It is said that in times of trouble,
this flame will rise up into an inferno as a signal to the Gods who are
said to reside to the northwest of the Endless Forest. Upon seeing the
signal, the Gods will don their weapons and come to the aid of the Druids.
#
@dig/tel Tower of Fire;room_id_119
#
@desc
A large supply of wood is stacked in this room, and a small firepit with a
ceremonial cooking tripod is positioned near the entrance. This is the 
first fire lit every morning in the Druid Palace, and all other fires
are lit from this one. Oaths and incantations of fire are sworn here.

The rocks of the firepit facing have been inscribed with glyphs, and 
some have been discolored to hues of blue and green.

#
@dig/tel Spire of Winds;room_id_121
#
@desc
You stand inside a tapering tower, with a long, narrow window situated 
in each of the cardinal directions. The floor has been tiled with a 
marble, which has in turn been decorated with strange patterns and symbols.

As you walk through the room, you encounter unusually strong air currents,
apparently stemming from the four windows. At the center of the room you
are buffetted with surprising violence. As the winds shake you, strange
visions come unbidden to your mind...a craggy fortress atop a mesa, green
valleys and mountains, a flapping raven, a bolting stag, a flood of 
crimson, scarlet, blue, and green, black and white trees...
#
@dig/tel Tower of Winds;room_id_122
#
@desc
This room is bare, and without decoration. Strange howls, groans and other
noises can be heard here. The intensity of the noises fluctuates from 
barely audible up to a chilling roar. It is difficult to tell the source 
of the noises, as they appear to emanate from the stone itself, in all
directions.

@dig/tel Chamber of Lore;room_id_124
#
@desc
A small fire crackles in this comfortable room. Over the fire roasts a
haunch of venison. Cushions and three-legged stools are arranged 
near the fire, and the candlelight is kept dim. It is here that the
venerable druid warriors sit to tell tales of battles long past to 
those who would listen, and prosper by them. It is also here, that
travelling bards often deliver epic poems from.

If you can spare the time, pull up a seat, grab a slice of meat, and
listen..for the old warrior has just downed his drinking horn, and
is about to begin another tale...
#
@dig/tel Druid Archives;room_id_125
#
@desc
A large oak and bronze table dominates this room. On its top are 
arrayed all manner of scrolls, books, and animal hides onto which
writing has been transfered. The table sits in the middle of the room,
and long shelves run the length of the walls. The shelves hold more
scrolls and books, and are marked in some obscure record system.

Though the Druids have long forsaken written records, the tumultuous
events of the recent epochs have demanded a more permanent attention
than the bards and minstels could provide.
#
@dig/tel Tuatha de Danan Hall;room_id_126
#
@desc
This large oval chamber is reserved as a shrine for the people known as
the Tuatha de Danans. It is unclear wether these powerful, magical 
people can be considered Gods or not, but better safe than sorry. The
chamber pays respects to those of the Tuatha de Danans known to the Druids.

The floor here is of stone, while the walls are of wood. 
#
@dig/tel Gallery of Dreams;room_id_127
#
@desc
This chamber is very dark, and appears empty. A railing runs along the 
perimeter of the wall, and you take hold. As you follow the railing 
into the room, the light from behind you seems to fade. The room did
not seem very long, but it feels as if you have walked for a very long
time here in the dark without encountering a wall. 

You get the feeling that there are many portals here, if one only knows
how to open them. With a shudder, you are thankful that such knowledge
escapes you.
#
@dig/tel Speckled House;room_id_128
#
@desc
This room is a very large rectangular structure, framed with great timbers,
and panneled with fine and exotic woods. It is here that the battle weapons
and armor of the Red Branch Warriors are kept. Shields, spears, and swords
virtually paper the walls, and with each set of equipment are the 
severed heads coated with lime that serve as trophies of valor.

There are no tables or places to recline in this room, and it is guarded
by strong magic which prevents and but the rightful owners to draw
the weapons from the wall.
#
@dig/tel Manannan's Hall;room_id_129
#
@desc
This hall is dedicated to Manannan Mac Lir, who some refer to as a God.
The floorboards have been died blue, and accommodations have been made
for sitting and reclining. 

It is here that craftsmen, smiths, and travelling merchants often come
to sell their wares and weapons to the Druids. Currently, several 
grisled smiths are here, extolling the virtues of their goods. A few
merchants from across the Ocean can also be seen praising the worth
of foreign articles.
#
@dig/tel House of Red Branch;room_id_130
#
@desc
This room is very large, and circular in shape. Tables, chairs, and mats 
are arranged throughout the room, and various lamps and candles provide
the necessary illumination. 

It is here that the warriors of the Red Branch stay when they are in the
Palace. A small cooking fire is usually kept smoldering, and the smell
of roasting meat fills the room.
#
@dig/tel Nuada's Silver Hall;room_id_131
#
@desc
This area is small, compared to most of the chambers and buildings in the
Palace. What it lacks in size, however, it makes up for in stunning
appearance. The timbers in the walls and roof have been carved into a
series of figurines, inlaid with silver. The floor seems to be one, huge,
flat stone. The stone has been carved to depict battle scenes. Almost
the entire eastern wall has been covered with a silver foil, upon which
has been engraved another mural.

#
@dig/tel Ach Samrath Gateway;room_id_132
#
@dig/tel Hewn Passageway;room_id_133
#
@desc
You stand in a rough passageway that has been hewn out of the rock
at the back of the initial cave. The passageway is almost a circular
tunnel. 

Jagged rock edges cut at you as you attempt to work your way farther
through the dark tunnel.
#
@dig/tel Sparkling Cavern;room_id_134
#
@desc
You now stand at the bottom of a large underground canyon. The "sky" 
for you is a dark roof of rock that is about 150 feet above your head.

Despite being well underground, a faint light exists in the cavern. The
source, as you soon notice, is the sparkling crystals that abound around
you. These small crystals glitter and shine mysteriously when exposed, 
and provide a glimmer of illuminescance by which you can find your way.
#
@dig/tel Rotunda Schlindera;room_id_135
#
@desc
Unlike the passages to the south, this underground chamber bears almost
no sign of natural formation. What may have once been a beautiful 
chamber has been chiseled, and mortared, into an impressive domed room. 

The floor here shows signs of much traffic.
#
@dig/tel Split-Level Stair;room_id_136
#
@desc
You immediately feel dwarfed when you enter this impressive chamber. The
ceiling of this boxey room rises over a hundred feet above you, while
the far wall is barely visible to you. 

On the side of the room, a narrow stairway works its way up the room's
wall, doubling back in its course several times. The terminus of the stairs
is not readily apparent in the gloom of this gargantuan chamber.
#
@dig/tel Jaws of Stone;room_id_137
#
@desc
The structure known as the Jaws of Stone is the northern entrance to the
tunnels and caves, not to mention the Warlord's fortress, that run under
the mountains. The structure derives its name, quite logically, from the
stone work that has been done around the cave mouth that leads into the
underground darkness. The cave mouth has been carved and worked to 
appear like a giant gaping mouth, resplendent with viscious fangs and teeth.

South lies the unknown darkness of the underground, as well as the entrance 
to the Warlord's fortress. North stretches open land.
#
@dig/tel Limestone Curtain;room_id_138
#
@dig/tel Underdeep Gate;room_id_139
#
@desc
A large passageway has been cut at this point into the eastern wall
of the basin. The mouth of the passageway is framed with stone blocks
mortared together in a crude arch standing 15 feet tall.

The arch has been decorated with a thick writing that consists of 
slashes and gouges into the rock. It is indecipherable to you.
Beyond this arch lie deeper, darker, and less pleasant caves...
#
@dig/tel Cascading Waters;room_id_140
#
@desc
You stand on a ledge looking out into a narrow well of a cave. Water
from above somewhere, drops in a small, but beautiful waterfall, past
this position and into a pool below you. 

The sound of the falling water is loud, but not overbearing. Where you
stand on the ledge receives a cool spray of water. You might be able to 
climb from where you are now up or down the side of the cylindrical
cavern of whose mid-wall you are now positioned on.
#
@dig/tel Green Pool;room_id_141
#
@desc
You stand in a relatively shallow cavern pool. The water is clear, fresh,
and cool, but the rock beneath the water is a light shade of green, 
giving a strange tint to the entire scene.

Water falls in a heavy rain from above. Looking up you notice that the
pool is merely the floor of a very large, cylindrical cavern. A small
underground river apparently runs into the top of this cavern, resulting
in a pleasing waterfall.
#
@dig/tel Top of Waterfall;room_id_142
#
@desc
A small torrent bursts out of the northern wall here, and rushes
over the floor ledge to fall in a noisy display through the 
cavern below into a waiting pool. 

The roof of this cavern is rather low, and you are mostly unable
to stand up fully. The ledge turns into a passage leading west.
#
@dig/tel Gallery of Weaponry;room_id_143
#
@desc
A narrow walkway leads through this long, man-made chamber. A wider step
area flanks either side of the walkway and leading up to the walls. 
Each of the two long walls here has been coated with a marble veneer,
constructed in a diagonal pattern of alternating stone types. 

Secured against the wall are weapons of various sorts and varieties. Most
appear very old, and a bit outlandish. Out of curiosity, you attempt to
remove one from the wall, but a strange force prevents you. 
#
@dig/tel Dwarven Smithy;room_id_144
#
@desc
This room is a large semicircle, with the flat edge being the
western wall of this room. Built in to the west wall is a large forge
of a truly exotic nature. There is no apparent means of supplying heat,
and no bellows. The forge does not appear to have seen use in a long time.

As you approach to investigate, the coals in the forge's heart begin to
glow with a faint green light. You can feel no heat, however.
#
@dig/tel Chamber of Echoes;room_id_145
#
@desc
The cave floor at this point is not solid rock, but is instead more
gravelly. The crunching noise made as you walk echoes through the 
expanse of the caves around you. Your attempts at vocal expression 
meet with similar responses. 

The passageway slopes steeply downward in a slide of gravel to the east,
while to the west is more solid footing.
#
@dig/tel Dark Basin;room_id_146
#
@desc
This is a large bowl shaped cavern. The cavern floor is thick with
gravel, and small chuncks of rock. There appear to have been some 
natural rock formations here at one time, but they have all collapsed,
or were smashed. 

The west half of the room is buried in a rush of gravel and debris, 
which has spillen over from above. Signs of worked stone are east.
#
@dig/tel Cavern of Bones;room_id_147
#
@desc
This chamber is round, and has a jagged ceiling consisting of a multitude
of stalactites. Slight trickles of water run down the formations from the
ceiling, creating a minor drizzle within the chamber. A small pool of 
water has collected in one corner.

The cave floor is covered with bones of all sizes, some very large. While
it is clear that the bones do not all come from one creature, a coherent
skeleton of something akin to a mammoth can be discerned.
#
@dig/tel Druidic Meadow;room_id_148
#
@desc
You stand on a flat expanse of green which intercedes the forest and the
Druid Palace. From here, you can look north upon the wood and earth 
ramparts and buildings of the Palace.

Despite the wild nature of the meadow, you get the feeling that it has
been carefully tended. To what end, however, you cannot be sure.
#
@dig/tel The Root;room_id_149
#
@desc
This room has been hollowed out of the earth. The stone steps leading 
up were clearly an afterthought. Some timbers serve to keep the ground
from rushing in and collapsing the room.

A large tree grows out of the earthen floor of this room, and extends 
upward into the rooms above. Many large roots are visible, and a 
particularly large one snakes its way across the floor into the
room to the east. You touch the trunk of the tree...and are oddly greeted
by a faint beating rhythm under the trunk.
#
@dig/tel Tunnel of Daggers;room_id_150
#

A single torch illuminates this rather un-inviting stretch of tunnel.
The sputtering flame has blackened the rough wall, and spews form a 
strong, acrid scent.
#
@dig/tel Spiral Stair;room_id_151
#
@desc
You stand at the base of a tightly wound spiral stairway leading far up
into the mountain rock.
#
@dig/tel Cliff Face Tower;room_id_152
#
@desc
You stand on the battlements of the Cliff-face Tower, which thrusts
itself out of the heart of the mountainside in order to peer down
upon the slopes and vale below.

The battlements are buffeted by a strong wind that invigorates you. 
Rising still further above the battlements is the thin turret of the
tower. You feel the strong urge to climb up to the highest point 
possible, in order to see all of creation.
#
@dig/tel Turret;room_id_153
#
@dig/tel Warlord's Gateway;room_id_154
#
@desc
This is the southern end of the Tunnel of Daggers. The passageway has
been widened and given extra heigth to the point where a room, of sorts,
exists here. While this area is unlit, light spills over from a side
passageway that leads west.

In the faint illumination, you are greated by an impressive stone portal
that is astride the corridor leading south. The gateway is open, and is
covered with runes.
#
@dig/tel Inner Portcullis;room_id_155
#
@desc
You are now just inside the outer gateway of the Warlord's mountain
fortress. Unlike the Tunnel of Daggers, the corridor here has been
carved out of the rock with great precision and skill. The wall and
floor surfaces are smooth.

South of here lies the first hall of the stronghold. Passage south,
however, can be effectively blocked through the use of the portcullis
that has been installed here. Fortunately, the portcullis is currently
raised, allowing you to slip into the stronghold with only stooping 
slightly, should you wish.
#
@dig/tel Sentry's Watch;room_id_156
#
@desc
This small room is half natural cave, and carved out of the rock. The 
floor has been chiseled smooth, while the roof is high and covered with
tiny stalactites. A warm fire burns here, and some meat can be seen
roasting over it.

This room serves as a guard post, and a sentry is usually placed here
at all times.
#
@dig/tel Hall of 1000 Spears;room_id_157
#
@desc
This cavernous hall existed long before this stronghold was ever built,
though the builders remain unknown. The room is very large in size, but
its occupants are even more impressive.

At first glance, you are greeted by a bristling army of soldiers and
lances. On closer examination you realize that the soldiers are actually
terra cotta statues. Rank upon rank they lie, arranged in companies and
echelons, 1000 in all. Legends say that these soldiers were once real men,
and will return to animated life yet again.
#
@dig/tel Hall of 10 Kings;room_id_158
#
@desc
This hall is relatively small, but has a certain stately air about it.
It is here that recognition is payed to the sporadic Kings that have
been associated with the Warriors and their Lord throughout the ages.

High on the walls of this room, are icons depicting 10 previous Kings.
No attempt has been made to indicate the name appropriate to each 
icon, and some of the subjects have faded from the collective memory
of Man.
#
@dig/tel Hall of 100 Battles;room_id_159
#
@desc
This chamber is of moderate size, and is clothed in tapestries of
blood red. Trophies from various battle victories are prominantly in
view here, while murals depicting past glory are draped by the red cloth
that cascades down from the ceiling.

A pile of small skulls commemorates a victory over a large force of 
Goblins, while a great sarcophogus serves as a reminder of campaigns
raged against the undead Mummy Kings.
#
@dig/tel Grande Ascension;room_id_160
#
@desc
You now stand at the central landing of a truly impressive stairway.
Very wide steps accompanied by stone railings arch out of sight both
above and below this point. The general darkness of this area enhances
the spidery appearance of the stairway as it reaches out, seemingly 
without support, into the dark void of some central cavern. You can peer
over the railing of the landing, and look into black darkness above and
below, puncuated only by the grey form of the winding steps.
#
@dig/tel Concourse of Virtues;room_id_161
#
@desc
You stand in a narrow concourse bedecked with arches and buttresses. The
ceiling is very high, and the intricate nature of the architecture lends
itself to more stately purposes, akin to that of a chapel. The flagstones
that floor the walkway of the concourse are "x's" that fit together 
snugly. Torches are placed at even intervals to provide light.

Your footsteps echo majestically as you stroll down the concourse.
#
@dig/tel Hall of Courage;room_id_162
#
@desc
This room is square, but has a domed roof. Small cords hang down from 
the center of the dome to be wrapped around metal rods that run along 
each of the walls. Tapestries hang from the cords.

The largest tapestry depicts a lone warrior, bloodied and mortally
wounded, engaged in battle against a horde of ghastly white humanoids.

This room has the same flagstones as the concourse to the east.
#
@dig/tel Chamber of Loyalty;room_id_163
#
@desc
This chamber is bare, and generally lacking of interesting features
save two items. One is the fresco that has been made upon the north wall.
It depicts a group of warriors defending a tattered banner against a 
host of large, fanged creatures. 

The other item is a large block of quartz which has been set flush into
the floor. Trapped inside the quartz is a sword. It is here that the 
warriors of the keep swear oaths upon the quartz, and the sword within.
#
@dig/tel Well of Truth;room_id_164
#
@desc
This chamber is oval in shape, and is rather small. A well sunk through 
the stone floor dominates this room. A low lip has been constructed 
around the well.

Peering down the well, you can see only blackness. You can hear the
sounds of sloshing water below, but it is fairly deep. A small winch
and bucket are suspended from the low ceiling. It has been fabled
that the well water possesses powers of truth, and that no falsehood can
be heard over the sounds of the water below.
#
@dig/tel Jade Market;room_id_165
#
@desc
This market is devoted to more frivolous items..precious stones,
silks and wrought iron.
You notice, however, a small rubbish pile in the shadow of a house
that has some possibilities..

When you dig through the pile you find old axes and hatchets, probably
to be shipped to the forest land but abandoned now. Iron bars from
which the artisans make their intricate lamps, lie in a pile unnoticed.
An enterprising man might make due with one of these as a weapon.

#
@dig/tel Vitae Arma Via;room_id_166
#
@desc
This passage is very narrow, and very tall. There is barely enough room
for one armored man to walk down the passage, but the ceiling risis
some additional twenty feet above your head.

Adorning the walls that stretch above your grasp are various pennants
and banners, as well as some shields and helms prominatly displaying
grandiose heraldry. It is unclear whether these are the booty of past
victories, or gifts of gracious allies.
#
@dig/tel Hall of Battle;room_id_167
#
@desc
This room is large and rectangular in shape. The wall surfaces are 
covered with thick woven tapestries which depict past feats of arms
and courage.

Most of the tapestries tell the story of large battles and campaigns
which are now long forgotten by most. The identity of the individuals
depicted is unclear. The "who's" and "why's" of the particular conflicts
shown, however, is unimportant. What is important, is that sword and
sinew met against like, and yet another test of warriors' mettle was
passed.
#
@dig/tel Mausoleum of Glory;room_id_168
#
@desc
This room is the terminus of what life holds in store for the man who
chooses the way of arms: battle, glory, and death. This room honors
the glory achieved by those of the past. The moment of victory, of 
timultuous triumph and painful loss, is honored here. Fame and glory
is fleeting, but this chamber pays tribute to all the success of arms,
to the instant when victory is fresh, and the dead are still warm 
upon the field of battle.

The room is walled in marble, and the hundreds of small niches carved

@dig/tel Cryptus Honorium;room_id_169
#
@desc
This small chamber is dusty, and smells of decay. Four closed doorways,
shrouded by a stone arch each, are set in each of the four walls.

A large stone block, some four feet high, has been placed in the center
of this otherwise bare room. Two crossed swords, and a heraldric design
have been carved into the surface of the block.
#
@dig/tel Upper Ascension;room_id_170
#
@desc
The grand central staircase on which you stand spirals beyond sight both
above and below you. The seemingly fragile stone steps work their way around
a central chasm. The spiral of steps gets tighter above, and wider below.

There is only a dim light here, but an ornate railing serves to keep you 
from falling to your doom in the darkness.

A small landing is at this point, and warm air enters from a northerly 
passage.
#
@dig/tel Wrought Power Hall;room_id_171
#
@desc
This chamber is large, but bears little decoration or ornamentation of its
own. Instead, it serves as a place to display the products of the forge,
and the skill of the smithy.

Weapons and armor of fabulous manufacture are on permanent display here,
while less esquisite items are arranged in less ceremonious stacks and
piles. A few items of gold and silver are also on display here.
#
@dig/tel Monstrous Bellows;room_id_172
#
@desc
Standing before you are the monstrous bellows which fire the forge. The
bellows are equal to the height of several men put on end, and are manned
by gangs of slaves who are chained to the bellows.

As the bellows are pumped, you can here the loud sound of rushing air. The
grunts of the slaves also accompany the rhythmic motion.
#
@dig/tel Humongous Forge;room_id_173
#
@desc
You stand in a large cavern, which is dominated by a forge of unusually
large size. It is here that weapons and armor are made for the warriors,
and here where the great smiths ply their trade.

Several smiths are busily working here at any given time. You notice that
many of them seem to be dwarves. They are totally enraptured in their work,
and are not aware of your presence.

You notice that a shaft has been cut into the ceiling above the forge, and
the hot air currents rise up through it. It is very hot here.

Tyviar the Ogre is here.

#
@dig/tel Gallery of Strength;room_id_176
#
@desc
The central floor of this chamber is sunken several feet below the 
level of the corridor. Stone steps, which serve as seats, run up the sides
of this large gallery. The sunken floor is covered with a thick layer
of sand and gravel. Several large torches provide light.

This room serves as a combat arena, where ceremonial battles and 
general competitions are held. Unarmed matches, as well as honor
deuls are all held here. 

The Warlord's place of honor is in the center of the east wall.
#
@dig/tel Stone Parlour;room_id_177
#
@desc
This room is bare, except for the stone bench that hugs the walls. It 
is here that those who wish to speak with the Warlord wait until it 
is His pleasure to admit them to his court. 

Two passages lead out of this room, to the east and to the west. The
stones around the eastern passage are brightly colored, while those
around the western have been tinted with dark hues.
#
@dig/tel Room of Bribes;room_id_178
#
@desc
This small room is dominated by a large brass container. The container
is roughly cylindrical, though it bulges out, and has a rounded top.
The top is continuous with the body, and has a small slot cut into
it. The bottom of the container is set into the stone of the floor.

Overcome by curiosity, you try to move the container, which stands
about 5 feet high, but to no avail. It is solidly in place.
#
@dig/tel Room of Threats;room_id_179
#
@desc
This room is irregularly shaped, being almost triangular. A long table
with some chairs has been set up in the center of the room, but to 
what purpose is unknown. 

A few candles provide some dim light, by which you can notice a large
dark smear which is spread over part of the table, a chair, and the
associated floor. Upon further inspection, you surmise this to be a
blood stain. It is dried, but not terribly old.
#
@dig/tel Room of Pleasantries;room_id_180

#
@dig/tel Room of Obsequities;room_id_181
#
@desc
A mat of woven reeds covers the entire floor of this small chamber. An
iron lamp, lit by the burning oil enclosed within, hangs from the 
low ceiling off to one side.

On the south wall has been emblazened the coat of arms of the Warlord.
On top of this has been hung two crossed swords. More ceremonial than
useful, the swords have been secured to prevent theft.
#
@dig/tel Warlord's Court;room_id_182
#
@desc
This room is rectangular, and its length stretches out before you to 
the south. A walkway proceeds down the length of the room, and it
is flanked by a series of iron braziers in which burn red hot coals.
At the end of the walkway is a stately, high backed seat of stone,
carved into the wall.

Iron rings and shackles are noticeable in the side walls. It is from these
that important slaves and prisoners are displayed for the benefit of
visiting personages.
#
@dig/tel Chamber of Ambitions;room_id_183
#
@desc
The western wall of this room has been covered with a huge animal hide,
of unknown origin. Upon the surface of the tanned hide has been drawn
a map of the known world, with the Warlord's Fotress occupying a slightly
larger space than is actual. Various markers and notations adorn the
map, indicating the broadening visions of conquest entertained by the
Warlord.
#
@dig/tel Den of Iniquity;room_id_184
#
@desc
Unlike the rest of the fortress, which is stone, iron, and generally
Spartan in attire, this room is plush and luxurious. A thick mammoth
hide carpets the floor, upon which are laid numerous cushions and 
pillows. A reclining chair is here, as well as a rosewood cabinet
which contains an impressive selection of imported spirits. Other
trinkets of value can be seen, while a hint of perfume hangs in the
air. An iron ring, and several sets of shackles have been set in the 
wall here, but it is doubtful if ordinary prisoners are ever held 
in bondage here.
#
@dig/tel Feasting Hall;room_id_185
#
@desc
This rooom contains a jumble of tables, benches, chairs, plates, cups,
jugs, food scraps, and various other remnants of a great feast. Much
of the remains have been picked over by the dogs of the keep, but
apparently no further effort has been made to tidy up the residue of
the wild bachinalia. 
#
@dig/tel Debauchery Chambers;room_id_186
#
@desc
Movable partitions divide this room into several smaller segments. The
partitions themselves are constructed of wood, and have been 
enriched with intricate militant designs. 

Within each of this rooms subdivisions is a small mat, a chair, a table,
and a jug of wine. 

An open path allows passage straight through the room.
#
@dig/tel Lower Ascension;room_id_187
#
@desc
Stone steps swirl out of sight both above and below your current
position. 

A slight breeze, of indeterminant origin and direction, greets you
with a whistling sigh. Faint light drifts down from torches above,
and moisture touches your skin almost like a misty rain. 
#
@dig/tel Dusty Landing;room_id_188
#
@desc
A grand, wide stairway stretches out into the blackness of a vast
cavern above you, while your immediate surroundings are dusty and
clearly not frequented. 

An open passage leads east.
#
@dig/tel Catacombs of Ghosts;room_id_189
#
@desc
This place is dark, cold, and damp. The smell of must and decay is 
strong here, and the reason is relatively apparent.

Set into the walls of this rough concourse are many burial shelves,
upon which rest old bones and urns of ash. Most of the shelves are
covered in a white burial shroud of cobwebs. Names have been 
recorded on the shelves, but time has erased many beyond the point
of legibility.

This is apparently not a place frequented by the warriors of the keep.
#
@dig/tel Tomb of William I;room_id_190
#
@desc
A long sarcophogus dominates this chamber. The lid of the sarcophogus
is topped with a life size statue of bronze depicting a warrior
in full battle gear lying still. The warriors hands are crossed over
his chest. A groove and appropriate indentations indicate where a 
sword once rested with the statue atop the stately coffin. 

The floor is tiled with white marble, and a thick velvet cloth has
been laid across the lower half of the statue.
#
@dig/tel Tomb of Lersing;room_id_191
#
@desc
A skeletal figure is positioned in a stone throne against the eastern wall
of this chamber. A large sword, unfortunately rusted beyond use, lies 
across the arms of the throne. The floor has been covered with an iron
grate, beneath which can be seen piles of bones and weapons. Apparently,
the things protected by the iron grate are the bones of those slain by
the deceased personage, accompanied by the booty he may have won. The
glitter and beauty of the objects have faded, and everything is thickly
covered with dust.
#
@dig/tel Hold of Halbarad;room_id_192
#
@desc
This small crypt pays homage to a warrior who was apparently much respected
at one time. The actual stone coffin has been interred in a vertical 
fashion, as if the deceased were standing up, and was sunk into the
floor of the chamber almost entirely. A simple stone marker identifies
the body as that of one known as "Halbarad". Two small stone statues,
depicting reclining mastiffs, flank the headstone.
#
@dig/tel Gurgling Spring;room_id_193
#
@desc
Into this small cave flows water from the south. In addition, fresh
spring water gurgles up from below. This rush of water is carried
away in a small river leading north out of the cave. The flow
passes through a small opening, unnavigable by humanoid creatures.

This cave is small in floor space, but it has a very high roof. Twisting
formations and ledges obscure the top of the cavern.
#
@dig/tel Rocky Hillside;room_id_194
#
@desc
You now stand on a steep hillside that is shadowed by the immense bulk of
the mountains rising up to the south. The hillside is littered with boulders
and rocks that have tumbled down from the heights above. Rock walls rise up
to the east and west of here, preventing passage in that direction. A
greener valley, however, lies north of here, down a steep incline.

From where you are, you can see a lone tower rising up out of the 
mountainside. The tower has thick battlements, as well as a spindly turret,
partially obscurred from this vantagepoint, that rises even higher. This
must be the Cliff-face Tower, the window of the Warlord.
#
@dig/tel Warlord's Vale;room_id_195
#
@desc
The Valley of the Warlord is nestled in the foothills of the mountains,
and lies under the shadow of the Jaws of Stone and the Cliff-face Tower.
The green grass of the valley floor is kept in shade by the adjacent
peaks except when the Sun climbs directly overhead at noon. 

From where you stand, you can look south towards the entrance to the
Warlord's domain. Rising out of the mountainside is the Cliff-face Tower,
with its spindly turret. 
#
@dig/tel Execution Road;room_id_196
#
@desc
This dark road leads north through the mountains, and is a narrow 
extension of the valley to the south. High mountains flank the 
road, and prevent travel east or west.

Placed at even intervals are the grim reminders of the Warlord's 
power: the rotting remains of those suffering execution at the command
of the Warlord. Some of the victims have been crucified, while others
were merely left to starve and die in iron cages.

The stench of decay and death fills the air.
#
@dig/tel Marble Escarpment;room_id_197
#
@desc
The mountains give way at this point to a stunning escarpment. The 
rocky peaks drop in an essentially vertical fashion down to a plain
some several hundred feet below. Where you stand, at the top of the
cliff, the ground is devoid of soil, and is a mixture of marble and
more common stone. 

From this vantage point you can look out over a vast plain of stone,
as well as the gaping pits that lie at the foot of the escarpment. The
mountainous formations at the top of the escarpment prevent you from 
going east or west, but a steep trail leads down to the plain below.
#
@dig/tel Quarry of Souls;room_id_198
#
@desc
You find yourself at the center of a vast marble quarry. It slowly dawns on
you that this whole gigantic plain of marble is one large quarry, and that
the great mountains to the south were chiseled and broken down to this
level for the sake of the marble here. It is mind boggling to consider the
millions of tons of stone that were removed, and the length of time that
must have been required to accomplish the task.

A wide, deep crevace runs through the marble plain at this point slightly
west of here. Otherwise, the plain of stone runs undisturbed for a great
distance.
#
@dig/tel Marble Plain;room_id_199
#
@desc
You stand on a vast plain of marbled stone. The rock is sometimes 
smooth, and easy to traverse, but often jagged and sharp, cutting your
footware and feet. The lack of shade or shelter on the plain makes any 
and all movement a hot, exhausting chore. Even motionless, you can feel
your strength being sapped by the powerful heat and sun.

The plain extends east and south of here. Some buildings rise up out of
the plain to the west.
#
@dig/tel Marble Plain;room_id_200
#
@desc
You stand on a vast plain of marble. The rock surface is sometimes 
smooth, but sometimes jagged and sharp. The lack of any shade intensifies
the feeling of exhaustion and insignificance you feel crossing the 
plain, as the sun beats down heavily upon you.

To the south you can see the mountains, while east is more lively
territory. The plain of stone stretches north and west.
#
@dig/tel Oracle of Delphi;room_id_201
#
@desc
Stately columns of marble rise up out of a bowl shaped ampitheater
here. At the center of the ampitheater is a small altar, where 
sacrifices are made to the Gods, and where divinations are conducted.

The Priestesses of the Oracle can be seen wandering around flurtively,
as they attend to the matriarch, the seeress of the oracle, the Sibyl.
#
@dig/tel Desolate Expanse;room_id_202
#
@desc
You now stand amidst a strange "wasteland". The ground here is rocky and
uneven, with tufts of shrub and other small plant life eaking out an
existance here and there. The whole scene appears as a parched landscape,
as if it has been scorched by a burning sun for ages. Oddly enough,
however, is the chill wind that rakes across the land from the north.

Looking north, you can see glistening snow fields and glaciers, a strange
contrast to this place. To the south are the mountains. West lies the
marble plain, while east the land looks similar to that here.
#
@dig/tel Salt Flats;room_id_203
#

This area is a great plain of salt. The sun reflects off the white 
surface with a brilliant glare, blinding you. You stumble and fall as
you wander around this place of glaring light. 

From the north you feel a chill wind. 
#
@dig/tel Windswept Tundra;room_id_204
#
@desc
A bitter wind from the north rakes over the short grass that grows on
this plain. The soil here is firm and dark, but frozen solid a few feet
below the surface. As such, no tall vegetation can grow here, only the
small grasses and lichens that you see.

Mountains can be seen to the north, while white fields are north.
#
@dig/tel Ice Wastes;room_id_205
#
@desc
A bluish tinged sun, low on the horizon, provides blinding illumination
reflected off the ice and snow that is all around you. A strong wind 
causes great, billowing swirls of snow that descend upon you vengefully,
aided by the stinging ice chips kicked up by the chilling forces.

The temperature is dropping quickly, and your face and hands become numb.
Your armor is burning with the cold, and even the thought of wielding 
your weapon is painful and cumbersome.
#
@dig/tel Rocky Foothills;room_id_206
#
@desc
You stand in the craggy rocks beneath the towering Ebonbane Mountains. 
The sharp jumble of stone and rock gives the impression that an entire 
mountain was crushed here, and the debris scattered for miles in front
of its lofty neighbors. 

What little soil exists in this area is gravelly, and unfit for most
plant growth.
#
@dig/tel Scorched Earth;room_id_207
#
@desc
This place, once a green plain, is now a blackened shadow of former life.
It appears as if some great fire swept through here, as the grass is 
charred and withered. Here and there, small blades of new life emerge
from the devastation, but for the most part this plain seems 
permanently dead.

Legends, if you wish to believe them, say that the great destruction
evidenced in these parts is the result of a terrible unleashing of
sorcerous power on the part of the Wizards.

The earth here has been scorched completely. The soil has been blackened, and 
lies in ashen clumps. What used to be small stones have apparently been melted,

very dry, there is no sign of the intense heat that caused this damage. In 
fact, a chill wind wistles over the black earth, stirring up ghosts of 
ashen debris.

This is the base of the seemingly impossible tower that rises above. The
tower has a slim base, but buttresses and wings that extend into space 
with no apparent support. From the outside of the building, you can see
domes and minarets rising out of spidery wings that extend out in 
right angles. Common sense would dictate that a strong breeze would 
topple this unlikely place, and yet it stands firm without a hint of
sway.

The base is open to the outside, with four slim pillars existing as the
sole foundation for all that towers above.
#
@dig/tel Unlikely Greenhouse;room_id_215

Bright sunlight floods this room of glass walls and ceiling. Green
plants flourish in this environment, and rows of tables hold small
potted plants. Flowers can be seen here and there.

Strangely enough, you notice that beyond the glass walls and ceiling
is not the bright sky you expected, but rather cold, dark stone which
completely encloses the room.
#
@dig/tel Rope Shaft Bottom;room_id_216

You are now standing at the bottom of a square shaft. The floor is of
wooden planks, but the walls have been constructed out of large stone
blocks. 

By the light of a single candle placed here, you see a rope dangling down
from the darkness above. Looking up the shaft you can see patches of
light and dark, but no specific shapes are discernable.

You hang onto the rope tightly as you climb into an area of the shaft that
is lit. A small candle has been affixed to the wall here. 

An open passage, and a small landing intersect the shaft to the south. You
need merely swing over a little and step onto the landing. Looking down,
you can see some light at the bottom of the shaft. Above is a dark shaft,
with hints of light.
#
@dig/tel Alchemist's Lab;room_id_218
#

The room is a immense, and itself alone would defy the flimsy support of
the tower as seen from outside. A score and more tables, all littered
with glassware and intricate experiments, are arranged thoughout the 
chamber. Here a dark potion bubbles and emits an orange gas, while
there a green liquid hisses with almost human contempt. 

Hanging from the high ceiling is an iron chandelier resplendent with wax 
globules that serve as candles. Under narrow arches, open passages lead
out of this room both to the east and west.
#
@dig/tel Reagentum Aureum;room_id_219

Four stout iron racks are in this room, on which are placed many small
glass jars. The containers hold pieces of a metal which is ostendibly
gold. Thick bars are held in place over the rack to prevent theft, and
a large padlock secures the whole apparatus.

A large balance hangs from the ceiling, with a comprehensive set of 
counter balances placed conveniently on one of the two tables that are
in this room. The tables are otherwise bare and free of dust.
#
@dig/tel Reagentum Argentum;room_id_220

This room is small, and has a low ceiling. The walls and ceiling are,
however, plated with silver. The silver coating is without any apparent
seem or gap, and the method of its application eludes you.

The surface of the silver is smooth and without any visible marks, with
the exception of a small corner where some of the silver has apparently
been scraped off. When you touch the wall, you feel a slight warmth, but
it feels slightly strange...as if you are not actually touching the wall
at all.
#

Huge blocks of iron are stacked in this room. The walls here are of stone
blocks mortared together, and there are no furnishings or other trappings
to be seen. 

Traveling through the room, you find yourself swaying involuntary, as if
you have lost full control of your limbs. It dawns on you that this might
be the result of the magnetic attraction between the huge mass of iron,
and the articles on your person. 

Some of the blocks of iron are soft to the touch, and yield like a sponge.

Wooden shelves and racks line the walls of this room. Glass jars and vials
filled with some mineral fill the shelves. Two large tables with high edges
occupy the center of the room. On one table an intricate apparatus has been
set up, in which some mineral samples are boiled in a liquid. A strong 
smell of sulfur is emitted. The other table holds a yellowish powder.

An alchemists glyph has been carved into the floor of this room.

This chamber is filled with a giant sphere, seemingly made of solid lead.
The sphere rests in the center of the room, and extends to the ceiling
some 20 feet above. There is room to move around the sphere, but only 
barely.

You are suddenly struck with puzzlement. The entrances into this room are
barely large enough for a man, let alone this giant ball of lead. 

An alchemists glyph has been inscribed onto the surface of the sphere.
#
@dig/tel Obsidian Stair;room_id_224
#
@desc
This room lies in stark contrast with most of the other rooms in this
structure. Every surface of the room is constructed of a black stone.
The stone seems to consciously devour all light, and pulsate with the
digested energy. A candle burns here, but its illumination seems 
hollow and insignificant.

Wide, low steps of the same black stone lead both up and down in front
of you. The air here is completely motionless, as if dead, but you do
feel a slight chill.
#
@dig/tel Climbing Stair;room_id_225
#
@desc
Steep, narrow steps lead further up into this improbable structure
from this point. The steps wind over themselves as they climb, and the
steps seem to have sprouted of their own accord from the wall which
they hug.

Looking up, the stairs seem unnaturally steep, almost vertical. At some
points, they even seem to be going upside down. 
#
@dig/tel Upper Obsidian Stair;room_id_226
#
@desc
You stand on a spiraling nightmare of utter blackness and despair. A pallid
light shines from below, but it is devoured without shedding its warmth or
hospitality. 

The steps are wide and low, though it is very difficult to distinguish
them in the darkness. As you walk the steps, you are greeted by silence. 
Even an echo would be welcome. Instead, the dark stone devours the sound
of your passage almost as soon as it is issued. You put your hand to the
smooth stone, but cannot determine is the pulsating sensation you feel is
from the stone or your own pounding heart.
#
@dig/tel Obsidian Chamber;room_id_227

This low roofed chamber is made of the same dark stone as the stairway that
leads up to it. There are no furnishings, as such, here. However, a 
myriad of objects, vials, and cages are strung with leather thongs from
small pegs that have just out from the wall. Occasionally, a small breeze
enters this chamber from the south, causing the hanging objects to clink
and jingle.

This room smells of chemicals, fire, burning flesh, and death.

black stone of this room. Like the chamber to the north, this roonm is
made entirely of an eerie black stone, that seems to absorb light, sight,
and even life. 

Some candles have been placed on the rim of the cauldron. They too are made
of a black wax, but they provide some necessary illumination.

You are on a walkway of marble leading through this spacious room. While
you do not wish to attract attention to yourself, you cannnot help but
stare at the scene before you. What can only be described as a demon
is restrained in some sort of magical cage in this chamber. A man in
a heavy cloak stands before the cage, making frantic hand gestures,
accompanied by some non-sensical mumbling. 

Suddenly, the magical cage is burst asunder, and the demon, holding a 
huge flail in one hand, grabs the man, and hauls him kicking and screaming
through a portal to hell.

A battle seems to be going on about you between a large, fanged monster
and several warriors. As you watch, the last living warrior is crushed
under the bulk of the beast, which then proceeds to devour the corpse 
greedily. This task done, the creature turns its eyes towards you...

iron railings. The walkway passes through an odd chamber at this 
point.

On the other side of the railing, to either side of you, you can see robed
figures moving about. Long hoods hide their faces, and they seem to take
little note of you. While all the figures seem to be moving intently on
their way towards some destination, their are no exits out of this room
outside of the walkway, which they do not approach.

@dig/tel Illusionary Walkway;room_id_235
#
@desc
This room is large and spacious. Three tables are here, cluttered with
vials and jars. The various containers hold specimens which run the
gamut of vegetable, mineral, animal, as well as otherwise...

A rickety stool has been placed between the tables, but it is now 
vacant.

The floor here is made of a smooth gray stone, but a stark line of
colorful marble starts in the center of this room, and travels west.
This walkway is about five feet wide.
#
@dig/tel Rope Shaft Top;room_id_236
#
@desc
This room is square, and has a low ceiling. An open trapdoor lies in the 
center of the wooden floor, and it reveals a dark shaft below. A rope has
been extended down through the trap door, but has not been fastened to any
support. As if by magic, the rope remains suspended in mid-air.

With every step you take, the floor creaks in protest of the strain.
#
@dig/tel Hemp Room;room_id_237
#
@desc
Long strands of hemp, from which the rope of the main shaft is constructed,
are piled here. It is difficult to tell whether the strands are the makings
of new ropes, or if they are rather the remains of failed ones.

The room is small and dark.
#
@dig/tel Room of Candles;room_id_238
#
@desc
The room is brightly illuminated by rank upon rank of sputtering
candles. While long wooden risers alight with burning candles run the
full perimeter of the room, additional candles have been situated
on stands and such of various style and construction.

Glyphs and markings have been made on the walls and floor of this room
with hot wax from the burning candles. 
#
@dig/tel Alibaster Stair;room_id_239
#
@desc
Wide steps of milky white stone lead further up into this abode of
the wizards. A banister and a flowing red drapery flank the gentle 
slope of the steps. A glyph of gold has been inlaid onto the surface
of each step.
#
@dig/tel Alibaster Dome;room_id_240
#
@desc
The floor of this large room is made of a milky white stone, as is the
dome which roofs it. The curved dome is a hemisphere which slopes down
to the floor. The apex of the dome is about sixty feet above the floor.

Hanging from the center of the dome is a small chandelier. The white 
surfaces catch the light favorably, and thus suffficient illumination
is provided from a small source. 

A wide stairway of the same white stone lies in the exact center of this
domed chamber, leading down.
#
@dig/tel Hall of Enchantments;room_id_241
#
@desc
This room is rectangular and has a high ceiling. The floor is of stone,
but the walls have been covered with a soft plaster.

Into the plaster has been inscribed strange, seemingly magical, runes and
writings. These writings cover nearly all of the available wall space.
A single table is the only furnishing here. A large iron candle holder has
been permanently affixed to the table.
#
@dig/tel Spinning Globes;room_id_242
#
@desc
This room is a narrow, long gallery. While devoid of furnishings, it does
hold a few objects which might spark your interest.

Floating in mid air in the room are 6 golden spheres. The spheres are all
of different sizes, and they have been polished to a bright shine. The
spheres' surfaces are smooth, and without any apparent marks.

As you approach one of the spheres, it drifts away out of your reach. The
process is repeated at each try. A slight humming accompanies the high 
speed spinning of the golden globes.
#
@dig/tel Dancing Daggers;room_id_243
#
@desc
You are standing in the southern half of a long, narrow gallery. The
gallery is devoid of any furnishings or frivilous trappings.

Floating in mid-air here are 7 daggers, of varying size and style. They
flutter and jerk of their own accord. As you approach they seem to sense
your presence, and their motion changes to a more agitated state. Most
of the blades hang point down, but one by one they turn toward you, and 
make threatening dives and swipes. The largest blade is stained with an
ominous crimson tinge.
#
@dig/tel Wizards' Banquetroom;room_id_244
#
@desc
This chamber is quite large and spacious. Several long tables have been
placed end to end to form an angular 's' shape. Benches accompany the 
tables, as do an occasional chair of more stately bearing.

Carved into the surfaces of the tables is an ornate snake that runs 
complete through the entire arrangement. Glyphs and writings appear
at various intervals, but to what purpose is unknown.

This room is illuminated, but no sources of light are visible.
#
@dig/tel Archmage's Study;room_id_245
#
@desc
This room is square, and vary small in floor space. You are puzzled,
however, by the immense, and paradoxical, height of the chamber. This room
alone, already high above the Ashen Plain below, seems as tall as the 
entire structure appeared from below. 

The walls of the room are continuous shelves of books and scrolls. A frail
metal ladder leads up the walls, and a spidery network of catwalks and
ladders allows access to the dizzying heights of the upper reaches.
#
@dig/tel Conjuring Room;room_id_246
#
@desc
This room is covered withh a thick, lush, carpet. A small wooden stand has
been placed on the carpet, upon which a book or scroll can be rested. 
Shallow shelves have been carved into the rock of this chamber, and they
are filled with small totems, trinkets, and spellcasting paraphenalia.

Clearly, this room is designed for the casting of spells, and the workings
of magic. The spellcaster can recline on the carpet and read the words of
invoking from the stand.
#
@dig/tel Initiates' Study;room_id_247
#
@desc
Orderly rows of tables and desks fill this rectangular room. Dusty volumes
fill a multitude of wall shelves, as well as the desks and tables. A
feeling of quiet and intent concentration fills the air here, even though
the room is currently unoccupied.

The faint smell of mustiness is somewhat masked by the odor of burning 
wax and animal fat. 
#
@dig/tel Errant Magic Room;room_id_248
#
@desc
The door into this room was stuck shut, and you get the feeling that
this may be a room that is usually avoided. The interior looks harmless
enough...dusty but mostly bare.

A small light catches your eye. What looks like a glowing lizard scurries
across the floor, only to dissolve upon reaching the far wall. A larger,
less recognizable shape begins to make a similar journey at a slower
pace. When it reaches its destination, it changes in an amorpheous fashion,
and divides into several smaller pieces which flicker and fade. 
#
@dig/tel Cantrips Gone Awry;room_id_249
#
@desc
This chamber is of smallish size and low ceiling. Some tables and chairs
have been placed here in seeming dis-array, as have a wide variety of
everyday objects. 

The flickering candlelight of the room gives the illusion of motion to the
objects here, or so you think until you notice that the candles themselves
are slowly moving towards you. A chair slowly scrapes across the floor, 
while a table jerks into deliberatee motion...all moving inexorably for
you. A brace of sticks begins to quiver with excitement, while a dagger,
glistening in the dim light, begins to hover...
#
@dig/tel Glittering Dome;room_id_250
#
@desc
This large room is roofed with a dark dome. Instead of being smooth, the
dome has a "honey-combed" look to it. Small points in the dome sparkle
and glitter, like light reflecting off of gold. There is no apparent
light source here, however, which would provide the necessary incident
illumination.

In the silence of this large darkened room, the glittering dome appears
as the heartful twinkling of a staar-filled night sky.
#
@dig/tel Damp Woods;room_id_251
#
@desc
The thick coating of leaves that seems to be everywhere throughout the
forest is sodden here. The wet leaves give only a slight whisper at your
passing, opposed to the usual grumble. The tree trunks and foliage 
glisten with an unnatural perspiration, as if a brisk rainfall had just
past. 

You can remember no rain, however, and even a harsh storm would not
penetrate the wood and leaf roof that is above.
#
@dig/tel Great Iron Doors;room_id_252
#
@desc
You stand before two vast iron doors, which block the entrance to the keep.
The iron is somewhat corroded, but somehow managed to escape the erosion
of some of the less fortunate parts of the fortress.
#
@dig/tel South Lake Shore;room_id_253
#
@desc
The oppressive bulk of the forest extends right down to the thin, rocky
shore of the lake waters. Outcroppings of rock, the lake waters, and the
forest itself prevent easy passage east or west off the lakeside rocks.
The only egress available is to plunge into the depth of the forest, or
to venture out on the lake. A voice inside you speaks against risking the
unknown darkness of the woods.
#
@dig/tel Abominable Forest;room_id_254
#
@desc
This section of the forest is the darkest and most tangled you have yet
encountered. No hint of sunlight breaches the perpetual midnight of the
forest floor. No undergrowth lives on the ground. In fact, most of the
wooden monsters rooted here are dead or decaying.

The normal sounds of the forest are absent. Instead, a low shuffling
seems to echo your movement through this tangle. Your own sounds are
impossible to conceal as you fight each step through the thick litter
of dead branches and lifeless brambles.
#
@dig/tel Enchanted Woods;room_id_255
#
@desc
Your senses inform you that this stretch of forest is out of the ordinary,
though for reasons you cannot readily identify. The trees seem strong, 
and un-naturally healthy. Their large roots rise up from the ground almost
like ambulatory appendages. 
#
@dig/tel Ent Grove;room_id_256
#
@desc
A small clearing exists here. The trees on the edge of the clearing are
arranged in a perfect circle, and seem to bow their leafy heads in 
reverance to a gnarled, ancient tree in the center. 

The central tree is somewhat small, with stunted branches. 
#
@dig/tel Hall of Nightflowers;room_id_257
#
@desc
You are in a long gallery which is only dimly illuminated. The walls
here have been carved so that their surface is covered with delicate
flowers. A long purple carpet leads away to the north, its length
embroidered with gold thread into intricate patterns of golden
blossoms.
#
@dig/tel Endless Forest;room_id_258
#
@dig/tel Great Temple Gates;room_id_259
#
@desc
You stand before the huge bronze doors that lead inside the Great
Temple of Goodness. These doors are never closed, so that the poor
and suffering may never be denied succor, nor the oppressed
protection. Let the forces of Evil fear the might of the Warriors
of Righteousness.

#
@dig/tel Moon Alley;room_id_260
#
@desc
Ivory colored ribbons hang down from the small stone figures embracing
the roofs of the alley. 
The Moon, a popular tavern, has its place on this road and the sounds
of happy revellers can be heard flowing from its open doorway.
#
@dig/tel Back Pub;room_id_261
#
@desc
This room is smoky and dark. Shadowy figures linger around the
edge of the room, or sit at the few tables here. Conversation is
generally low, and the you get the idea that outsiders are not
welcome here.

A very large, but unlit, fireplace is against the north wall. It is
so big, in fact, that a man could almost stand inside it comfortably.

#
@dig/tel Thieves Guild;room_id_262
#
@desc
This room is dominated by a long table, and usually contains a few
shady characters enaging in a game of cards, throwing knives, or
relating exaggerated exploits. The decorations are far more exotic
and luxurious than one might expect, and leads one to think that
perhaps they have been stolen from other locations.

#
@dig/tel sewer3;room_id_264
#
@dig/tel Cold Corridor;room_id_265
#
@desc
You find yourself in a wide crack that runs through the glacier. The
opening is wide at the bottom but tapers sharply as it extends 
upward. Strangely enough, the floor is smooth and even. 

The path of this passage is fairly straight, with only a minor veer
here and there. There is no wind here, but you are filled with a 
feeling of immense coldness, which saps your strength and will. Being
in such close proximity to the ice here heightens the chill.
#
@dig/tel Blue Hall;room_id_266
#
@desc
This chamber shows signs of stonework and the structure partially
visible from the ice fields nearby. The ice of the glacier and the
stonework seem to blend together as if they are the fused parts
of a larger organism. Where the ice ends, and the stone begins, is
not clear.

The floor of the room is hard and flat, and is a combination of stone
and ice that conform to the same level and texture. The surface is 
engraved with a giant pattern, which looks reminiscent of a snowflake.

#
@dig/tel Upper Crypt;room_id_271
#
@desc
This dim chamber is cluttered and dusty. A large stone sarcophogus is
here, but it has been cracked and damaged. Some tracks on the dusty
floor indicate recent passage, but the room smells of death and decay.

#
@dig/tel Ice Ballroom;room_id_272
#
@desc
The lower walls of this area are of stone, but they give way quickly
to tiers of ice that hang like glamorous balconies over the floor
below. A strange, chilling mist rises of the perfectly flat ice 
floor of the room. It swirls a bit before dissipating only a few
feet from the surface.

Far into the ice above, intricate figurines can be seen. The nature
of the carvings is not clearly visible from here, however.
#
@dig/tel Chior of Icicles;room_id_273
#
@desc
The roof of this chamber is lower than that to the south, and from it
hang a solid cluster of icicles. The icicles are of great size, 
stretching from the ceiling some fifteen feet above down to the floor.

Passage through this room is difficult as you have to pick your way
through the inversely tapering columns of ice that block your path.

Light filters in from above somewhere, and fills the room with a dull
light amplified by the white iciness of the structures within it.
#
@dig/tel sewer5;room_id_274
#
@dig/tel Hole of Maximus;room_id_275
#
@desc
This room is half filled with salt, which cascades into the room from
above. Smaller trickles lead down through tiny holes in the floor of
this chamber to further hidden places. At first you discard this 
place as nothing more than an uninteresting nuisance. Then you notice 
the objects and other signs of habitation. Then the footprints. 

The broken remains of human weapons are half buried in the white drift
of salt here. You also notice small footprints made in the salt, and not
yet obscured by its motion, tha indicate that someone has recently left
this chamber.
#
@dig/tel Crumbling Alley;room_id_276
#
@desc
Tall buildings flank this old alleyway, though they are in the
critical stages of decay. Large blocks of stone have fallen from above,
and the alleyway is largely closed off. Much of the stone on the northern
and of the alley is blackened, as if a fire once destroyed some of the
buildings here.
#
@dig/tel Guild Forum;room_id_277
#
@desc
You stand in a square forum which is faced by the fronts of majestic
looking buildings. The floor of the forum is of marble, and the 
dedication markings which have been inscribed there indicate that 
this place was once the home of the great Guilds of the Realm.

You notice old wires running above the forum between the building 
fronts. It takes you a few minutes to spot the remains of the 
faded tarpualin that could be pulled along the wires to cover the
forum from the elements.
#
@dig/tel Ruined Guild;room_id_278
#
@desc
You stand in the main chamber of one of the Guild houses that has
survived the ravages of time and natural disaster rather well. This
entrance hall is spacious, but rather bare. Some tables remain here,
with some accompaning chairs. A faint rug remains here, though it has
been worn through. A main hallway once led west, but a partial collapse
of that area of the Guild house prevents you from going that way. 
A smaller door has been jarred open to the north, however.
#
@dig/tel Guild Rostra;room_id_279
#
@desc
At the eastern end of a roughly square forum lies the speaker's 
rostrum from which speaches were made to the assembled crowds and
guild members. The rostrum itself is a wooden podium which stands atop
a marble platform.
#
@dig/tel Burnt Building;room_id_280
#
@desc
This structure was of wood, and long ago burnt to the ground. Blackened
timbers lie amongst the piles of ash that lie here motionless. The lack
of wind has kept the ash and charred remains of the building clumped
here together for ages.

The covering of ash is several feet thick, and dark grey.
#
@dig/tel Wizard Archives;room_id_281
#
@desc
This small chamber is lined with stone racks housing documents and
books, most of which are now crumbling and useless. A central table 
is here, but it has been crushed by a large block of stone which has 
fallen from the ceiling. 

This room lies below the level of the street, and you must climb
down a short set of steps to get into the room, and likewise climb
up to get out.
#
@dig/tel Festival Place;room_id_282
#
@desc
This wide avenue is flanked by the remains of tall residential 
buildings. The remains of two small fountains can be seen adjacent 
to the street, as well as that of small shops.

You infer that this district may have been used for public festivals
of perhaps celebrations to commemorate some civic event.
#
@dig/tel Ancestor's Field;room_id_283
#
@desc
From this vantage point, clear of the buildings, you can observe the
nature of the place in which you walk. In place of the sky, a stark
night of stone greets you. The remains of this place were apparently 
long ago swallowed up by the earth. A vast cavern extends around 
this old city. In some places it appears as if the world of rock 
that lies above was simply dropped down upon an unsuspecting town.

Where you stand in particular appears to have been a park or gathering
field of some sort.
#
@dig/tel Library of Ancients;room_id_284
#
@desc
You stand in a building that clearly was once used as a library.
Unfortunately, it has seen better days. The delicate spiral steps that
once lead up to a second floor have now collapsed, and the books that
adorned the many shelves lie scattered and shredded about the room. 
The damage looks more like the work of a natural disaster and great time
than that of an invading foe or vandal.

Wings of the building once extended off in many directions, but now they
have mostly collapsed, and are impassable.
#
@dig/tel South Wing;room_id_285
#
@desc
This must have once served as a study room of some sort. A grand oaken
table dominates the room, and the remains of some majestic books and 
scrolls are in plain sight. 

Curiosity peaked, you begin to thumb through one of the books...only to
have the pages crumble in your hands.
#
@dig/tel Caved-in Wing;room_id_286
#
@desc
You slowly pick your way amongst the rubble and debris scattered about
as the result of the collapse of the roof and upper floors into this 
wing. 

The remains of what was likely a desk, and perhaps a personal quarters
can be seen to the west, though it has been smashed by the weight of the
wood and stone lying on top of it.
#
@dig/tel Sealed Entrance;room_id_287
#
@desc
What was once a gate leading out of the city lies here. Like many areas
of the city, the surrounding cavern wall has cut through the existing 
structures, as if the rock was dropped onto the city, or as if the 
city was transported into this void. 

The wooden remains of various riverboats and trading goods can be seen
lying about, as if a river once lied beyond the gate.
#
@dig/tel Cold Anvil;room_id_288
#
@desc
You stand in a wide, but low, building. The floor is of dirt, covered
with straw. Benches containing various tools and implements stand idly
about. In the center of the room lies a large anvil, on a base of wood,
which it in turn seated upon a pit of gravel. An ancient forge can be
seen in the corner, that it long ago collapsed in upon itself.
#
@dig/tel Forsaken Armory;room_id_289
#
@desc
This building is short of width, but extends down in front of you for
some way. The room has been floored in wood, and a clutter of 
workbenches and tools lies in the far back. Near the door lie several 
standing wooden racks upon which were displayed suits of armor. 
Many of those still here have decayed into uselessness.
#
@dig/tel Fire-Ravaged Guild;room_id_290
#
@desc
Thus once majestic Guild has been gutted by fire. The skeletal remains
of upper floors and adjacent buildings can be seen above, but most of
the structures in this area have fallen into a huge pile of ash, charred
timber, and fallen stonework. Near the doorway you find a brass plate,
identifying this as some sort of craftman's guild.
#
@dig/tel Room of Study;room_id_291
#
@desc
This chamber is smaller than the entrance hall, and contains many
desks and tables. Clearly this was some sort of school or study
chambers. Books lie on shelves and open on the desks, but every 
attempt to make to examine them resuls in the crumbling destruction
of the documents and pages.
#
@dig/tel Chamber of Splendor;room_id_292
#
@desc
This chamber appears rather spacious and exotic. For some reason, the
ravages of time which have afffected some much else of this city, have
left this room untouched. Though abandoned, it looks as if this room 
was only left a few days ago by its occupant. The thought slowly 
strikes you that perhaps this place was not protected from aging, but
that rather all the other places of the city were unnaturally aged
in some form.

By the look of the furniture and trappings of this room, a person of
great influence and power resided here.
#
@dig/tel Place of Graves;room_id_293
#
@desc
You stand amongst the many white headstones which mark the graves of
those who were buried here unknown centuries ago. The remains of strange
herbs still remain near some of the graves, as do other interesting
items that were apparently offered to the dead, possible the result of
an ancestor worshipping cult.
#
@dig/tel Collapsed Temple;room_id_294
#
@desc
This was once a place of worship for the now long dead citizens of
this city. The orderly long rows upon rows of seating have been 
disturbed by the collapse of some upper tower of steeple, which 
brought a good section of the roof down with it.

The upper end of the building, where a sacrificial altar of some sort
may have stood, has been buried by the rubble.
#
@dig/tel Via Paladinia;room_id_295
#
@desc
Fallen buildings lie on either side of the road here. Only the foundations
of what must have long ago been exquisite villas remain. One of the 
buildings has collapsed into the street, creating a minor obstacle 
which you surmount with minimal difficulty.

As you distance yourself from the center of the city, the structures 
seen to be more intact. It is almost as if some disaster hit the center,
and radiated outward until it died out.
#
@dig/tel Via Paladinia;room_id_296
#
@desc
You are on a road which intersects with what may have been some sort
of business district in days gone by. The front faces of tall buildings
flank the narrow road, creating an even eerier setting amongst the strange,
hazy light that is here. Stepping through a random doorway to investigate,
you find nothing but rubble beyond.

A large building lies immediately to your east. It seems largely intact.
#
@dig/tel Moneylender's Abode;room_id_297
#
@desc
You enter a wide building, of which only the first floor remains intact.
Many tables are set up around the room, and racks along the walls hold
scrolls and parchments. You inspect such, and make them out to be
transaction ledgers of some sort. 

Heavy dust has settled on everything, and loose parchments are scattered
about. Some loose coins and money can be seen.
#
@dig/tel Avenue of Kings;room_id_298
#
@desc
You are on a minor road which is flanked by majestic statues of 
marble and bronze. The road is cobbled, and is accompanied by wide
drainage sewers. 

You look upon the statues of those who must have held great power in
days gone bye, and wonder at what has become of them now...
#
@dig/tel Small Marketplace;room_id_299
#
@desc
You stand in a small marketplace that lies astride a minor road that
runs north of the ampitheater. The road widens at this point into a 
small square, in which a fountain still stands. A withered old tree
hangs limply over the fountain. 

A large statue once stood here, but it has been toppled and broken.
Chips and pieces of marble lie scattered nearby, intermixed with the
rubble of lesser works.
#
@dig/tel Narrow Avenue;room_id_300
#
@desc
You are on a narrow lane which runs south into a larger road. The 
buildings which once lined the lane have largely collapsed, leaving 
wide gaps where the lane runs along exposed houses and buildings.
#
@dig/tel Unusual Building;room_id_301
#
@desc
This room seems remarkably well preserved, if unusual. Once inside the
small doorway, you are greeted by several sprawling stone tables. You
walk over to one to find a crytsal cup still resting upon it. Looking
around, you see curved pillars reaching up towards the ceiling which
is still intact. An iron chandelier hangs down. Spiral patterns can
be seen worked into the stonework on the floor.
#
@dig/tel Ampitheater;room_id_302
#
@desc
You stand at the lip of an oval ampitheater which slopes down in
front of you. The center floor of the ampitheater is of sand.

A slight breeze moves over the open seats and steps, moving the haze
which hangs in the man-made gulley. Amidst the deadly quiet of the 
near darkness you can almost here the roar of a crowd, and the sounds
of those who once were here.
#
@dig/tel District of Borba;room_id_303
#
@desc
A narrow street from the north empties into what once have been a busy
business district here, but which now lies deserted and in ruins. The 
dusty remains of commerce stalls and old shops can be seen flanking
the district. They are backed by the crumbling remains of old buildings.
Behind the buildings to the south you can make out the dark form of
the rock curtain which surrounds these remains.
#
@dig/tel District of Borba;room_id_304

This area is flanked to the south and east by the dark rock wall. The
buildings which once lied along these edges stand sliced in two. The

@dig/tel Anciatus Terminus;room_id_306
#
@desc
You stand before what was once the end of the old city. Just past the 
signpost indicating the end of the town, a dark curtain of solid rock
has been dropped down. The rock extends to your west as well, obliterating
anything that may once have been there.
#
@dig/tel Senatorial Curia;room_id_307
#

This was once some sort of governmental building. The curtain of rock
however, has been dropped through the center of this room, cleaving it
in half. 

Various appendages of administration and beuracracy abound, though 
clearly much worse for the wear over the passing over many years.
#
@dig/tel Obsidian Landing;room_id_308
#
@desc
The black steps from above terminate in this dark chamber. The wide 
steps turn into a flat plate of blackness, complemented by the walls
which are of similar nature.

The only light available here comes from a faintly burning candle 
affixed to the wall of a passage leading south. The passage is narrow,
but tall, and is also made of the smooth blocks of black stone.
#
@dig/tel Chamber of Ancients;room_id_309
#
@desc
The vaulted ceiling of this chamber lies above you in a triangular arch,
while the floor is of sand. A spiral pattern has been drawn in the
sand, and has laid undisturbed for many centuries. Small colored
pebbles have been placed at 'significant' places in the pattern.

Light coming from the passage leading north illuminates the room dimly.
The air here is very still.

On the southern wall there is some ancient writing. Look closely to
decipher it's mysteries.
#
@dig/tel Bowels of Monster;room_id_310
#
@desc
You stand in a large chamber that has been constructed with huge 
blocks of stone. The floor of the chamber is circular, but three
dimensionally, the chamber is tear-drop shaped. The rough blocks 
overhang those of the lower tier slightly, and mortar has not been 
used. The whole chamber reminds you of a structure created from the giant
blocks of a child.

In the center of the chamber, a small flame burns atop a bubbling pool
of some dark liquid.

#
@dig/tel Top of Demon's Shaft;room_id_312
#
@desc
The obsidian passage from the north widens only slightly at this point, to
form an oval chamber in whose center lies the round abyss of the Demon's
Shaft. There is another pallid candle here, whose dim light was enough to
prevent you from taking that unknowingly fatal step into the circle of
bottomless black. 

The Demon's Shaft is an exact circle cut through the black stone. The sides
of the shaft are completely smooth, and the lip makes a sharp edge with the
floor. The area around the hole is free of all marks, though a raised 
cylinder of stone, about eight inches high, stands starkly by the dark well.
#
@dig/tel Low Tunnel;room_id_313
#
@desc
This tunnel is wide, but has a very low ceiling, forcing people of human
height to stoop in order to travel through it. Most of the rock surfaces
are rough, and sharp, though the floor has been worn smooth by the 
passage of many feet. It seems clear, however, that this tunnel has not
seen much traffic in recent times.
#
@dig/tel Giant Web;room_id_314
#
@desc
The tunnel at this point is sealed by a series of giant spider webs. The 
webs are like solid sheets of silky white cloth, finely woven into the 
surface of the rock. The air here is deadly calm, and not a hint of breeze 
disturbs the frail barracades. 

You notice a cut has been made through the webs. Apparently someone has
been this way before...
#
@dig/tel Forgotten Cave;room_id_315
#
@desc
This cavern is large, and was apparently a place of some significance. The
walls of the roughly round chamber have been worked to from a set of low 
steps which probably served as a seating area. A large stone formation 
rises from the center of the room, and is capped with a natural basin.

In the basin is a pool of liquid which burns with a nearly transparent 
flame. Apparently a supply of water tainted with a natural combustive 
liquid is forced up the length of the formation into the basin, causing 
this perpetual flame.
#
@dig/tel Place of Memories;room_id_316
#
@desc
This is a cylindrical cavern. Standing in the center of the cave is a 
large quartz formation. The bottom part of the formation is the same grey
stone of the rest of the cave, but it gradually gives way to a yellowish
quartz.

The quartz takes on a roughly diamond shape is about 5 feet long. When you
touch the cloudy stone, a jolt of scenes rush into the cave, though they
are wispy and clearly an illusion. You see small, fanged, humanoid creatures
the likes of which are unfamiliar to you. They seem very barbaric, but 
the scene is dominated by a sense of remorse and loss.
#
@dig/tel Salt Cave;room_id_317
#
@desc
A thick coating of salt crystals covers the floor of this chamber, giving
it a white, wintry appearance. The salt is visible in the walls and roof
of the cave, which also shows signs of humanoid hands. 

The cave seems rather damp, and the air has a taste of salt to it.

You notice salt trickling down several small holes in the floor. The holes
almost have the look of sinkholes. The motion of the salt reminds you of
an hourglass, ticking away the seconds of your life, ticking away to an 
imminent disaster.
#
@dig/tel Rubbish Heap;room_id_318
#
@desc
This cave appears to have served as a communal garbage heap for eons. 
Layer after layer of filth have been piled up in here in a display 
that is truly awesome, and enough to turn your stomach. The disgust
evoked by the vision is only to be matched by that caused from the 
stench that rises from the huge mound. Decaying flesh, and rot, are
prime among the diverse scents that reach your senses.
#
@dig/tel Cave of Mortem;room_id_319
#
@desc
A small platform constructed of loose rocks is here. Upon the platform 
is a wooden chair. The chair is ringed by a circle of skulls that have 
been cleaned and polished. 

Some mangy skins and such also complement the room, but there is little
else of consequence. The are signs of fairly recent occupation, and 
something has been chiseled into the floor of the cavern.
#
@dig/tel Goblin Throne;room_id_320
#
@desc
This chamber is long, and of low roof. It has the feeling of immense 
age, and looks as if it has not been disturbed in centuries. The room
is mostly empty, whatever treasures might have been stored here are 
now long gone. 

The sole occupant of the chamber is a lonely stone throne. The throne is
richly carved. The more you look at the images depicted there in crude
detail, the more you begin to fear what terrors may lie within these
caverns deep under the mountains. A thick layer of cobwebs shrouds the
regal seat with a sad finality.
#
@dig/tel Deserted Village;room_id_321
#
@desc
You stand in a darkened glade that serves as the center of the surrounding
village. Being underground, no light should be present, but a hazy 
illumination permeates the gigantic cavern which holds the remains of
this village. 

The trees in this area have all died, and some have toppled to the ground.
Small doorways can be seen to the sides, but there is no sign of recent
habitation. Looking up, you notice wooden platforms and complex structures
that have been erected amongst the treetops.
#
@dig/tel Empty Marketplace;room_id_322
#
@desc
This wide clearing near the center of the village was on open air
market, in which the villagers and visitors must have sold their goods.

Some small trinkets remain, crushed into the dirt, but the surrounding
forest which lent cool shade to this clearing has died, and all that
really remains is a patch of hard ground.
#
@dig/tel Abandoned Shop;room_id_323
#
@desc
A long counter runs the length of this room. Behind the counter are many
shelves, while in front of it are rotting sacks and barrels of various
sorts. It is obvious that this was once a store of some sort. 

The shelves behind the counter have been smashed, and the contents lie
in a heap of broken merchandise on the floor. A long blood stain
darkens the counter.
#
@dig/tel Fire-Gutted Temple;room_id_324
#
@desc
This was probably once a place of worship for those who inhabited this
village. It looks as though the people payed homage to some form of forest
deity. 

The temple had no real walls, but tall trees growing side by side formed
an almost solid wooden screen about this sacred place. In the center, 
is what once must have been a truly tremendous tree, judging from the girth
of the silvery trunk that remains. All the trees have been burned from the 
top down, leaving only blackened stumps.
#
@dig/tel Scorched Grove;room_id_325
#
@desc
A small spring once gurgled to the surface here, surrounded by the
colorful flowers and dignified trees of this grove. All that remains
of the vegetation now, however, is blackened stalks and tree-trunks.
A fire must have ravaged through this area, and you wonder if perhaps
that was the reason why this village was left deserted.
#
@dig/tel Withered Wood;room_id_326
#
@desc
You walk amongst a tangled forest of dead trees. Many have fallen,
blocking passage through this confusing jumble of trunks. After
fighting your way past several annoying obstacles, you spy a path 
leading west.
#
@dig/tel Fallen Tree-House;room_id_327
#
@desc
You have stumbled across the remains of what must have been a modest,
but quaint, abode in the trees. The trees on which the house was supported
have collapsed under the weight of their burden, and have brought the
structure toppling down to the ground. The house has largely been smashed
into kindling, but ordinary objects such as tables and chairs, have been
spewed out onto the floor of this dead forest.

Just beyond this point to the west lies the black rock wall of the 
larger cavern in which this village now lies.
#
@dig/tel Mass Grave;room_id_328
#
@desc
A very large pit is here. In it lie the remains of many people, reduced
to yellowed skeletons. A token effort was made to cover the remains,
but that is about the extent of any pleasantries accorded those 
who are buried here. 

Beyond this pit lies the rock wall of the huge cavern in which this
village rests.
#
@dig/tel Decaying Library;room_id_329
#
@desc
You stand in the entranceway of a building which has survived whatever
ravages destroyed much of this village. The construction is entirely 
of wood, and from what you can see is very finely done. The architecture
mixes natural beauty with a touch of artistic creativity to create
what must have once been truly stunning. 

From what you can see, this was probably a library of some sort. Wooden
arches extend to the east and west of this room, apparently leading
to other wings. The second level also appears intact.
#
@dig/tel Upper Library;room_id_330
#
@desc
You are on the second floor of a wooden building which lies at the
southern end of the village. At this point the structure merges with 
the surrounding trees, and is open on the north face. 

Wings of the building once extended to the east and west. The wing to the
west has collapsed entirely, crushing the building directly underneath it.
The wing to the east is in almost as bad a condition, but not quite. You
could try to pick your way though it.
#
@dig/tel Bridge of Despair;room_id_331
#
@desc
You stand before a frail bridge which overloods a dry riverbed. The
bridge itself is of a thin stone, and has been carved with reliefs 
depicting a raging river. From the river emerge horses born of its
frothing foam. While inspiringly decorated, you are not sure you want
to trust your life to the bridge.
#
@dig/tel Dry Riverbed;room_id_332
#
@desc
This is a dry riverbed, flanked on both the up and downstream side
of its course by rough rock walls. It is almost as if a world of rock
descended upon, and crushed, an existing world.

The dirt here is sandy, as if it has been without moisture for eons.
#
@dig/tel Place of Lies;room_id_333
#
@desc
This chamber is slightly rounded, and has some racks and cabinets against
the far wall. The racks are empty, as are the open cabinets. A large
stack of papers and books were apparently dumped in the center of the 
floor here and set alight. Very little remains to be examined.

Markings, slogans, and exhortations adorn the walls here. By the look
of it they were put here by the villagers. From what you can make out
they are some form of propaganda, instructing the populace to obey
orders and work harder.
#
@dig/tel Looted Treasure Room;room_id_334
#
@desc
After steeping through the door, you realize that this was once some 
sort of vault. Chests and various locked containers remain here, but
their valuable contents have all disappeared. From the disarray apparent
here, whomever removed the valuables likely did so in a hurry.
#
@dig/tel Heap of Debris;room_id_335
#
@desc
This wing of the library has been crushed by the collapse of the upper
level above it. What remains is a tumultuous heap of wooden debris.

A chair remains just inside the entrance archway. It is of wood, and bears
carvings of woodland scenes.
#
@dig/tel Dead Branch;room_id_336
#
@desc
As you step onto the wide branch, it gives way underneath your weight.
For a split second you are in free-fall until the branch catches, and bends,
upon a lower tree. The wood of the branch is dead and rotted, and 
compresses with surprising ease under the wieght of your footsteps.

A small vine serves as a railing here, but if it is in the same condition
as this branch, you would be well advised not to trust your life to it.
#
@dig/tel Shaken Platform;room_id_337
#
@desc
This is a wide platform constructed of timbers lashed together. The 
weakness of the dead trees on which the platform rests causes it to
pitch wildly as you step onto it. It repeats this motion as you shift
your wieght and move around.

It is on raised platforms like these that much of the now gone 
populace lived on. The fallen remains of other platforms can be seen
from this vantage point through the hazy light present here in this
huge cavern. A lashing of tree branches forms a roof above you, while
a main trunk continues up through the roof.
#
@dig/tel Forgotten Room;room_id_338
#
@desc
This chamber sits atop the branch roof of the platform below. It has walls
constructed of wood, and a trap door can be brought down and bolted to
prevent entrance from below. The room is now empty. Its purpose remains
a mystery.
#
@dig/tel Rubble-Choked Wing;room_id_339
#
@desc
Large trees from the dead forest surrounding the structure have come
crashing through this area. The roof, and much of the floor, has
collapsed or been ripped away. A large bin can be seen in the far end
of this chamber. Taking a closer look, you notice that the bin contains
numerous vertical slots, into which have been inserted many scrolls.
A quick examination of the scrolls reveals that they were likely of a 
magical sort. However, any magic they once may have held seems to have 
faded with the people who once lived in this place.
#
@dig/tel Thinning Branches;room_id_340
#
@desc
Only the dead calm air makes travel over the thin, dead branches of this
area possible. A little wind would send you falling down to the ground below
with a multitude of rotted wood after you.

A tight overlay of dead branches forms a plausible walkway amongst the
trees. In greener times, the view from here was probably quite stunning.
#
@dig/tel Blackened Eaves;room_id_341
#
@desc
You find yourself walking gingerly upon a crispy rope bridge that 
connects two platforms. All around you are the blackened tree-tops that
remain as a testiment to some great fire. A clearing has been burnt in the
forest below, but it is difficult to make out any details from here.
#
@dig/tel Crumbling Platform;room_id_342
#
@desc
This platform is more steady than the other, but it is no more safe. The
wood of the platform has rotted through, and pieces of it give way wherever
you step. It is impossible to tell what was once here, as fire and decay
have destroyed everything. To the north of here you can see the black
form of the cavern's wall.
#
@dig/tel Hidden Stair;room_id_343
#
@dig/tel Wilted Lothlorien;room_id_344
#
@desc
You stand in a large underground world, filled with a miraculous 
species of tree. This is but a part of a humongous cavern which 
extends far to the south. Rough igneus rock walls greet you to all
other directions.

The foliage here is now wilted and dead, but you can imagine that the
towering tree trunks that remain, slightly tinted with a silver,
were once wondrous to see.
#
@dig/tel Rat's Haven;room_id_345
#
@desc
This chamber has been crudely burrowed out of the earth, and is 
uneven and without definitive shape. Gathered here is an innumerable
writhing mass of rats. 

The normal rats seem to cower in reverence of a truly huge specimen
of rodenthood. The monster rat is several feet tall, and sports 
a brace of sharp teeth. 
#
@dig/tel Corridor of Stench;room_id_346
#
@desc
This passage is square, and all its surfaces are flagged with smooth
stones. Magical stones, which glow with a faint blue light, have been
set into the wall to provide illumination. All attempts to remove these
stones meets with failure.

The corridor is filled with a terrible stench of decay and rot. The 
smell brings to mind a vision of a field of rotting flesh, or rank
upon rank of dead.
#
@dig/tel Rotunda Mortis;room_id_347
#
@desc
This chamber is large and circular. The roof is domed, and rises to
a star-shaped piece at the apex. Short corridors, leading to visible
steps lie to the north, east, and south.

The floor here is of smooth stone. The center is covered with a
mosaic depicting the Sun being devoured by some darker diety of
an unknown religion.
#
@dig/tel Steps of Famine;room_id_348
#
@desc
A wide set of steps fans out before you, covered in dust and age.
They have the look of crumbling instability, but you are not deterred.

As you begin to walk down, you feel a great hunger gnawing away at you.
The stone of the steps begins to crumble under your weight, throwing
you off balance. Your downward motion is the unsteady, stooped 
progress of one beset with great weakness and infirmity.
#
@dig/tel Steps of Strife;room_id_349
#
@desc
The stair that lies before you has steep, narrow steps. The wall is 
jagged, and leans into the pathway which you must travel in order to
descend. As you squirm slowly down the dusty steps, the rock edges
cut at your exposed skin, drawing a minor trickle of blood in a few
places. A feeling of claustrophobia begins to overcome you.
#
@dig/tel Steps of Disease;room_id_350
#
@desc
Wide steps lead down a dusty corridor here. A fresco follows on the
accompanying wall. The fresco is faded, and depicts a group of tall
humans afflicted with a form of severe malnutrition. A dark form,
clearly of some distinct caste or existence, moves among the others.

Thick cobwebs cover the steps, and dust floats heavily in the air.
#
@dig/tel Grand Mortuary;room_id_351
#
@desc
You find yourself in a large chamber of low ceiling. Some long tables
can be seen as well as some wooden boxes which may very well be coffins
of some sort. This area has the appearance of a mortuary. 

Upon closer examination, the boxes do indeed appear to be coffins, but they
are caked with dirt and mud. Peering inside one, you get the feeling 
that it was once occupied, but is now empty.

There is a faint glowing here which provides light, but it is from an
unknown source.
#
@dig/tel Dead Vault;room_id_352
#
@dig/tel Passage of Undead;room_id_353
#
@desc
You find yourself in a long dark passageway. You are forced to feel your
away along in the dark. Your hands move along the smooth walls..which
at first seem very close together, but then diverge. Your hands touch
each wall as it slowly moves away from the other, and yet your arms 
never seem to lift up or lose contact with the surface. 

As you walk along, you feel a slight breeze, and whisps of lighter 
shades of dark move past you. A flickering light appears, and disappears
in the distance far ahead of here. Once the light is gone, you feel as
if you are in even deeper darkness.
#
@dig/tel Flame of Souls;room_id_354
#
@desc
This chamber contains an immense wooden throne which appears to have
been sculpted from the ancient, gnarled tree which is behind it. The
tree's branches arch over to form a lofty canopy of golden leaves
above the throne. A few marble pillars stand silently, as if in
testament to the timeless majesty that this chamber embodies.
#
@dig/tel Room of Living Death;room_id_355
#
@desc
This room is irregular shaped, and completely carved out of a smokey
white crystal that looks like very cloudy glass. The walls are somewhat
jagged, but the floor and roof are perfectly smooth, flat, and parallel.
A pale light seems to radiate from the floor. Looking down, you can see
mist swirling on the floor. You reach down, but realize that the mist
is actually swirling inside the crystal. While you are enraptured by
this phenomenon, another occurs. A sheet of mist slowly emerges 
from one of the walls, as if its incorperal being is being dragged
out from hiding. It swirls through the air, and appears to be 
pulled back into the opposite wall.
#
@dig/tel Gallery of Hungers;room_id_356
#
@desc
You have reached a long, narrow chamber. The walls are covered in rough
tiles of pale earthy colors. The ceiling is high above you, and cannot 
be seen clearly in the darkness. A faint source of light is south,
but the sensation of hunger and weakness slowly grows within you as you
take each step towards it.

A small groove runs down the length of the gallery. It is about an inch
wide, and two inches deep.
#
@dig/tel Chamber of Poisons;room_id_357
#
@desc
A light fills this chamber, stemming from a fire which burns here.
Slicing through the room is a rivulet of molten rock, which pools in
the center before exiting through the opposite wall. Small flames
dance on the molten rock, and give off noxious vapors which fill the
room. 
#
@dig/tel Place of Deep Misery;room_id_358
#
@desc
The floor of this circular chamber is covered in sand. As you step 
into the room, you quickly sink a few feet down into the sand! Buried
underneath the covering of sand are jagged rocks which slice and rip
at your flesh. The pale sand of the room greedily absorbs your blood 
as it is spilled!

Slowly you pull yourself up, and reach a more solid footing. A sense
of great regret and misery fills you, as you look at the sandy 
floor that is capable of devouring so many things, perhaps even your
will and soul.
#
@dig/tel Smoking Mirror;room_id_359
#
@desc
A long black mirror covers the northen end of this room. As you 
approach it your reflection seems to fade in and out, while smoke
drifts along the surface of the mirror. As you get closer, you can no
longer see a reflection, only blackness. The smoke almost seems to
be drifting out through the mirror. Reaching out, you touch the dark
glass, and are comforted to find it firm and solid. 

An angular pattern has been made with the colored floor tiles here.
Light enters the room from the south.
#
@dig/tel Temple to Death;room_id_360
#
@desc
This dark cave appears to have once been a secret entrance into
deeper caves. The tunnels farther back from the riverbed have been
blocked by rock and other rubble, apparently barring all passage.
The remaining chamber in which you stand is circular, and rough, with
a trio of carved pillars rising up. The pillars, upon closer
examination, have been carved to represent humanoid figures whose
faces are contorted in expressions of extreme pain or rage.

#
@dig/tel Tezcatlipoca's Hall;room_id_361
#
@desc
A walled pool of dark liquid is here. The liquid is very still and 
torpid. You approach the pool and stir the waters with your weapon.
The waters respond sluggishly, and quickly return to a state of inactivity.

The floor of this chamber is a tile mosaic, depicting a large jaguar.
The colors are faded, but were once bright.

#
@dig/tel Malus Occulus;room_id_362
#
@desc
The floor of this chamber appears to be of a hardened clay. Drawn into
the clay is a complicated design and motiff, which itself is dominated
by a large eye. Writing of an unknown language runs along the edge of the
floor near the wall.

The walls are smooth, and of a very non-pourous stone. 
#
@dig/tel Cold Basement;room_id_363
#
@desc
You find yourself in a basement. The basement is walled with a collection
of mortared rocks, but possesses a dirt floor. You notice that there
are some bone fragments scattered about. You also see tracks in the
dirt floor. The tracks are obscured, as if a heavy object was being 
dragged, and lead from the steps to the center of the basement.

It is very cold here.
#
@dig/tel Chamber of Wasting;room_id_364
#
@desc
The walls of this room angle inward, while the floor is concave. A mat
of woven reeds covers the floor, and is accompanied by an ancient 
wooden bowl. Woven into the mat is a design crudely depicting a 
bird. 

The wall is covered with red markings and crude paintings which
depict a withered field and gaunt livestock.
#
@dig/tel Room of Rotted Flesh;room_id_365
#
@desc
The stench of decay is very strong here, overpowering and sickening 
you as it fills your nostrils. Sprawled out before you is a corpse
of untold age. Yet despite such, it remains in a state of continual
rot and decomposition. Considering the age of the surroundings, nothing
should be left of the body except bone fragments. Yet, the corpse 
looks as it is has only been dead a few weeks.
#
@dig/tel Goblin Forge;room_id_366
#
@desc
This is a large cavern with only one very narrow entrance. The
cavern is almost unbearably hot, as a gigantic furnace dominates
the place. It is here that the fiendishly clever goblins fashion
their implements of war and torture, and melt down the pitifully
beautiful objects of Mankind they find.

@dig/tel Resuscitation Room;room_id_374
#
@desc
This room is cold and dark, being unlit by any recognizable means. The 
wall and ceiling surfaces show a rather rough finish, but the floor
has been chiseled smooth. Straight lines have been carved deep into the
floor, however, and they progress from each of the four corners and walls
towards a small circle in the center of this square room.

As you approach the carved circle, and begin to hear a faint noise, like
water rushing over smooth rocks. As you reach, and touch, the circle,
your vision is flooded with color, as streams of energy flow from the walls
down the lines, and into your body.
#
@dig/tel Shaded Courtyard;room_id_375
#
@desc
You stand in an open courtyard which is shaded by the high walls
and buildings which surround it. It is cobbled with small dark
stones, between which straggly dark weeds occassionally emerge. A
portcullis and gate is to the east, and solid structures north.

#
@dig/tel Upper Res Ab'tyrr;room_id_376
#
@desc
You have entered one of the many sleeping chambers of the inn, a bright
cheerful room with murals painted on the ceiling and walls. A large
window framed in ivy faces the direction of the setting sun.

A small, but comfortable, cot is in the corner. Feel welcome to lay
your weary self down for a rest.
#
@dig/tel Res Ab'tyrr Balcony;room_id_377
#
@desc
From here you can enjoy the view of the city rooftops and follow the
turning roads into the heart of the city.
In the distant west the temple district can be seen and the dome of
the fearful Chaos Cathedral. 
The great gate and old wall that kept enemies of old from breaching
Tai-Tastigon lie to the north, with the great plains and forests 
stretching out beyond them.

If you strain your eyes, you may catch a glimpse of a river running
through the south of the city.
#
@dig/tel Chaos Cathedral;room_id_378
#
@desc
You stand in a cathedral of truly unusual design, and nature. The walls
all seem to be of different heights, and whats more, of different
proportions. Walls meet, and yet, it doesn't appear that they should.
An aisle runs lengthwise down this central portion of the cathedral,
but its positioning seems to change with each glance. The more you
stare at things, the more they seem to change, and the sense of
motion begins to make you feel ill.

The cathedral is topped with a dome is darkened glass. While the sky was
dry from outside, the dome seems to be enduring a rough rainfall.
#
@dig/tel Altar of Uncertainty;room_id_379
#
@desc
Standing on a flat marble surface is the altar of the cathedral. Like
many of things here, its form undergoes change. At one moment, it 
seems solid and impressive, the next it is a molten blob of 
liquid metal. By its transmutations, the whole altar seems to defy
reality, and mock the concept of truth. It is unsettling for you 
to watch the altar for any length of time.
#
@dig/tel Nave of Confusion;room_id_380
#
@desc
This long, narrow section of the cathedral is filled with the fanfare
of Chaos, emanating from an unknown source. Accompaning the music
is a fast moving swirl of colors that obscurs, or perhaps is, the
ceiling of this section of the cathedral. The dressings and curtains
here sway as if from a strong wind, but you can feel no breeze.
#
@dig/tel Cathedral Dome;room_id_381
#
@desc
You stand on a narrow ledge on the inside of the cathedral dome. The
dome is constructed of subsequent tiers of adjacent metal and stone
arches. The lowest tier of arches is open, and allows passage to
the outside ledge surrounding the dome. The upper portions of the dome
are covered in dark glass. Unlike the view from below, the dome when
seen up close seems rather ordinary and solid.

A series of interconnected and adjacent rooftops lies to the south, 
while to the east you can see the upper stories of the Res Ab'tyrr,
the main inn of the city.
#
@dig/tel Crumbling Buttress;room_id_382
#
@desc
A frail stone buttress, severly weathered by the elements, connects 
the upper sections of the Res Ab'tyrr to the dome of the Chaos 
Cathedral. You are now walking gingerly on this stone bridge, in the
hopes it will not give way under your feet. You feel it would be wise 
to make as much haste across this structure as possible, without
subjecting it to any undue strain.
#
@dig/tel Road of Gods;room_id_383
#
@desc
You are upon a narrow street which is walled with odd, and downright
peculiar, buildings. The building faces come right up to the street,
and tower down over those walking by. These buildings are the places
of worship for the people who follow the many diverse cults and sects
which are prominent in the city. 

The throngs of people you see here are all dressed in unusual fashions,
proudly proclaiming the fanatical cult of their choosing.

You stand in a small square which is filled with citizenry of all sorts.
Surrounding the square are the large buildings which are home to the
more popular cults of Tai-Tastigon. Small shrines, and altars, have
been inserted between buildings and in alleyways, making use of
all available space. 

A short lane intersects the district from the east, and connects it to
the large open plaza which is the heart of the city.

@dig/tel Crocodile Cult House;room_id_385
#
@desc
This building is filled with tropical foliage, and is very damp and
humid. Potted plants, and transplanted trees make travel through the
room difficult. You slowly make your way towards the back, however,
and are suddenly greeted by a hissing, snapping Crocodile. The 
reptilean beast is collared and chained so a low altar constructed of
stone and tropical wood. A pool of greenish water is behing the altar.

You spy a set of steps in the corner which lead up.
#
@dig/tel Lizard Temple;room_id_386
#
@desc
This spacious building is neatly arranged. A triangular seating 
arrangement faces a large glass cage, in which are several small, but
brightly colored lizards. Some artificial trees have been added to
decorate the room, and perched on them are many somewhat larger, but
generally lethargic, lizards.

A small passage leads north out of this room, towards some sort of 
enclosed courtyard.
#
@dig/tel Snake Cult Temple;room_id_387
#
@desc
The floor on the interior of this building is sunken, and is covered
with a writhing mass of snakes. The snakes are a variety of colors and
species, some of which may be poisonous. There are no other 
decorations or objects stored here.

At the far end of the room you can see an enclosed stairway that leads
upward.
#
@dig/tel Crocodile Pit;room_id_388
#
@dig/tel White Doorstep;room_id_389
#
@desc
You stand on an elaborate doorstep of marble and white wood. Delicate 
ironwork, painted white, circumnavigates the door, which is shrouded 
in an arched mantly of gleaming marble. A door-latch of ivory catches
your attention, as to the curving elephant tusks which accompany the 
door itself, which is made of a white wood.
#
@dig/tel Opium Palace;room_id_390
#
@desc
This room is exceedingly large and decadent. A ring of thin columns 
surrounds a pool of water set into the floor. Marble and bronze statues
abound, as do clinging vines and rare works of art. Partitions of silk
and rosewood divide the extremeties of the room, which fragile arches
of blue-veined stone guide you as you walk through the opulence which
is displayed here.
#
@dig/tel Opium Lounge;room_id_391
#
@desc
You have entered a plush lounge. The floor is covered in a thick carpet,
and a cushioned bench runs the entire perimeter of the walls. Stationed
in the center of the room is a monstrous hookah pipe, which can be 
utilized from any corner of the room. Small incense burning braziers
are at work here, as well as a supply of candles to provide a dim light
within the smokey atmosphere.
#
@dig/tel Baths of Xiombarg;room_id_392
#
@desc
You are in a large, and well cared for, bath-house. Before you stand the
public pools of alternating hot, tempid, and cold water. Servants bear
towels and refreshments to the more important personages who may be
found here.

Steam drifts from the back of the bath-house, were saunas, and more 
decadent pleasures, are attended to.
#
@dig/tel Steamy Rafters;room_id_393
#
@desc
You have crawled into the upper rafters of the building. The wood here is
damp and dripping, and the air is hot and moist. Steam rises from below,
obscuring your vision. 

Small vents which allow the steam and heat to escape are nearby. One of the
vents is near a stone ledge which runs along an adjacent structure.
Another vent lies within view of another rooftop, to which you might
conceivably jump.
#
@dig/tel Road of Rooftops;room_id_394
#
@desc
The rooftops in this part of the city are very close together, allowing
quick passage across them, faster than travel on the streets below.
The only drawback is the occasional fall. Though not usually fatal, 
these accidents can be painful.

The roofs are a mixture of thatch, flat stone, tin, and tile. The
variety keeps the travel interesting as you hop from roof to roof.
#
@dig/tel Upper Croc House;room_id_395
#
@desc
The floor of this large room is bare, but has been decorated with a
mosaic of a huge crocodile. 

The smell of incense is strong here, and a small fire burns in the 
corner. The room is otherwise empty of objects. 

A large swinging door on the north side of this room leads out onto an
open veranda. Nearby rooftops are close to the veranda, and could 
provide a means of egress should the need arise.
#
@dig/tel Wooden Walkway;room_id_396
#
@desc
You find yourself on a narrow, and seemingly unstable wooden walkway.
The walkway leads up to a wooden door set into the second floor of 
a building to the east, while also curving around to lead into a 
structure to the south.

Looking down, you are greeted by a pool of dark water. Shapes seem to
be moving in the water. Hopefully they are just harmless fish of some

#
@dig/tel Reptilean Concourse;room_id_397
#
@desc
You are on a roofed, but otherwise open-air, landing that stretches
across the tops of two neighboring temples. The floor of the landing 
is covered in a large mosaic, depicting various reptilean creatures.

There are some large potted plants here, of a tropical variety. They
partially obscure a stairway that lies on the western edge of the 
landing. Another, more visible stairway leading down lies before you.
#
@dig/tel Guildmaster's Room;room_id_398
#
@desc
This room is smaller than that of the one to the east, and is a
bit more cozy. A small conference table is here, as well as some
comfortable chairs. It is here that the dealings of the Thieves
Guild are discussed.

#
@dig/tel Wind-beaten Ledge;room_id_399
#
@desc
You are standing on a narrow stone ledge that runs along a series of
interconnected structures along the bank of the river. The ledge runs
close by a window on the upper level of a structure too the west. Far
to the east, the ledge runs by another opening set high in the rafters
of a second building. 

The ledge is buffetted by high winds, and is dangerous.
#
@dig/tel Rocky Shore;room_id_400
#
@desc
You stand on a rocky shoreline which does battle with the violent,
crashing waves of a tireless sea. The uneven field of rocks extends
for some distance inland, and you can see small islands of outcropping
stone further out to sea. The sea, as if in a flanking manoever, has
cut deeply into the shore to the west. Far to the west you can see
land which extends almost out of sight to the south. This land is
heavily forested, and the trees meet the sea in a the form of a dirty,
root-choked cliff.
#
@dig/tel White Sands;room_id_401
#
@desc
A decent stretch of glistening white beach lies here, backed by a 
high rock wall. The beach gradually slopes down into the Ocean, as
it is pelted by wave after wave. 

The sun gleams off the waves in the distance, and a cool breeze 
greets you coming off the water.
#
@dig/tel Sea Cliffs;room_id_402
#
@desc
You find yourself on a thin stretch of shoreline which hugs the high
cliffs rising behind you. A faint trail can be followed to the north,
which slowly winds its way up to higher ground. The cliffs extend 
around to the east, and are an impassable obstacle there.

Looking south across the Ocean, you see endless waves and the blue 
of the sea. A comfortable breeze drifts in from the Ocean, and the
sound of the waves crashing against the cliffs to the east fills you
with awe.
#
@dig/tel Mountain Pass;room_id_403
#
@desc
Among the lower peaks of the mountains, this pass is one of the few
places where the mountains can be crossed without serious difficulty.
The air here is thin, but crisp, and the view is astonishing.

Far to the west you can see the mist shrouded shape of the Great 
Forest. Off to the east, you can see the walls and buildings of the
city of Gods, Tai-Tastigon.
#
@dig/tel Vale of Tai-Tastigon;room_id_404
#
@desc
This valley is at the foot of the Ebonbane Mountains. Rising to the
immediate west is their impressive bulk. To the east, the valley
widens out into a plain, where the city of Tai-Tastigon is situated.

A path leads to the south, where you can here the crashing of waves.
#
@dig/tel the Tavern Roof;room_id_405
#
@desc
You stand upon the gently sloping roof of a tavern located near
a square. Taller buildings nearby obscure much of your view.

#
@dig/tel Chamber of Quartz;room_id_406
#
@desc
This chamber is roughly hewn from a quartz rich mineral deposit, giving
the impression from above that anything in the room actually lies trapped
within the rock.
#
@dig/tel Glacial View;room_id_407
#
@desc
The wintry landscape that lies all about you is dominated now by the
jutting mountains of ice that are thrust up from the snowy earth. To the 
north lies a particularly impressive wall of solid ice. A peculiar, dark
shape lies near the base of the glacier.

To the west are rough, and impassable, glaciers. While the wind has died
down, it is still terribly cold here.
#
@dig/tel Frozen Gates;room_id_408
#
@desc
You stand at the base of a giant wall of ice. You can now see that the
dark shape viewed from afar is actually a structure frozen in the 
glacier. 

In front of you is a large gate, leading into what appears to be a 
palace of some sort frozen into the glacier. The gates have a large,
and somewhat unnatural, keyhole in them. You try to open the gates, but
they are apparently frozen tightly shut.
#
@dig/tel Meadow Gate;room_id_409
#
@desc
You have entered the first gate into the city of the gods...Tai-tastigon.
The structure of the walls suggest a city that was once heavily fortified
but now rather neglected. Perhaps a confidence in a security that is
misplaced.
#
@dig/tel Old Wall entrance;room_id_410
#
@desc
This is the inner wall of defences, long since abandoned and fallen to
ruin. Before you lies the labyrinthine city of Tai-Tastigon, roads
laid out like an achitect's nightmare.
#
@dig/tel River street;room_id_411
#
@desc
You are surrounded by tall angular buildings that frame the twisting
road as far as you can see. There is some light filtering in from
a passage from the north but the other exits seem to be wreathed in
gloom.
#
@dig/tel River alley;room_id_412
#
@dig/tel Audience Hall;room_id_413
#
@desc
You stand in a large audience hall. Row upon row of elongated tables
have been arranged around an altar like construction against the
north wall. In the dim light, you can barely discern massive columns
which reach up into the cavernous heights of this chamber.

#
@dig/tel Res Ab'tyrr entrance;room_id_414
#
@desc
Welcome to the House of Luck-Bringers!

The Res Ab'tyrr is the finest inn in Tai-Tastigon. It is a large building
painted with intricate designs. It has a fine reputation for both food
and board, and it is located in one of the nicer areas of the city.
However, the Res Ab'tyrrs' fame springs from the whimsical good luck
figures of stone that adorn the face of the building and its upper
stories that give it the name of Luck-Bringer.
#
@dig/tel Street of Streams;room_id_415
#
@dig/tel the Serpent fountain;room_id_416
#
@desc
In the center of the square is a marble fountain carved with fantastic
sinuous beasts. Alas, it stands empty...

Along the road you can see many fissures through the cobblestones
than run through the fountain and into the narrow buildings surrounding
it.
#
@dig/tel Way of Tears;room_id_417
#
@desc
You have wandered into a winding alley that serves the followers
of the Chaos Cathedral..
The houses around you have been scarred with the memory of the power
that flowed through here when the Cult was a great power in the land.
Their power now lies dormant but none know how long this peace will
last...

#
@dig/tel Armorers Row;room_id_418
#
@desc
You notice that there is more merchandise is this small shop, especially
items of greater value. Handsome suits of chain mail and ring mail armor
are displayed on wooden dummies against the wall, highly polished and
gleaming in the light.
A few plumed helms with gaudy feathers decorate the heads of the wooden
figures. You see horned helms piled in the corner. Bucklers of every
shape and design form the centerpiece of the back wall.

You stand at the crossroads shaded by a large stone arch with the
emblem of the kings that once ruled this fair land.
#
@dig/tel Charnel House;room_id_423
#
@desc
You have stumbled into the macabre happenings of the charnel house of
Tai-tastigon. The smell of emblaming liquids, and various chemicals
is strong here, as well as the smell of the perfumes used to hide
the stench of death and decay.

The structure is currently empty, as far as you can tell, of live
souls. You wander amongst the tables and bodies, but soon get a 
strong urge to leave this place.
#
@dig/tel Lower Town Entrance;room_id_424
#
@desc
This area of the city, once rich and prosperous, is now tainted with
darkness. The fine houses have been reduced to burned shells and blackened
hovels from a fire that raged through these parts.
Lower town is now used as a refuge for criminals and dark spirits that roam
the night.

It is not recommended that you wander through here at night...

#
@dig/tel Fleshambles street;room_id_425
#
@dig/tel Old Wall;room_id_426
#
@desc
Before you stands a man dressed all in black.  Flowing ebon robes open up
here and there in the breeze, betraying a black coat of armor beneath.
Under the man's hood you can just make out his facial features--long flowing
black hair, full black beard, and jet black eyes.  This, then, is the Black
Druid, the famed Lord Terminus...
#
@dig/tel Dry Moat;room_id_427
#
@desc
The dreaded Wyldibeast pops up, clubs you over the head, and carries
you off!!
#
@dig/tel Mountain Gate;room_id_428
#
@desc
You have entered the eastern gate of Tai-Tastigon. The gate affords
an impressive view of the great Ebonbane mountains rising over the
the Vale. This gate, like the others of the city, have fallen to
ruin because of the relative peace throughout the land. Defenses
have been neglected by those secure in the maze that protects them.

The gate holds a worn inscription: 
           Peace to all who pass through me!
#
@dig/tel Common Room;room_id_429
#
@desc
You have entered the great common room of the Res Ab'tyrr. Chandeliers
throw a dim light upon the polished wood tables that grace this
extablishment. There is a platform along one wall for harpers to sit
and entertain guests and servants scurry to and fro carrying drink
and food for tired travellers.

#
@dig/tel Dark Chambers;room_id_430
#
@desc
A few flickering torches illuminate this chamber, which appears to
be some kind of conference room. The shadows flitter about the
edges of your sight in a disturbing fashion, making you feel ill
at ease. A slight damp breeze disturbs the still air occassionally,
accompanied by a curious rustling sound.

#
@dig/tel Cook Room;room_id_431
#
@desc
You have entered the kitchen of the Res Ab'tyrr, a cosy and inviting
room smelling of herbs and spices. Numerous pots and pans hang along the
walls and an appetizing smell is coming from a pot set in one of the
many fireplaces along the walls.

This room is for the staff of the Res Ab'tyrr only! Vistors are welcome
to relax in the common room.

#
@dig/tel Back Alley;room_id_432

In this small cul-de-sac you feel quite cornered and wish
you could get out faster.

A foul stench wafts up from a sewer grate.
#
@dig/tel Silken dark;room_id_433
#
@desc
A street to the north empties into the district, which was once perhaps
alive and bustling with activity. Now, however, it lies deserted and in ruins

The remains of some buildings flank the district, and empty commerce stalls
can still be seen. 
#
@dig/tel North Fosse;room_id_434
#
@desc
You notice that there are fewer houses in this area.

There are a few public houses here that are frequented by those who
disdain the more expensive taverns in the heart of the city.
#
@dig/tel Waterfront;room_id_435
#
@desc
As you stand by the bank of the river you can see the islands of the rich
cradled within. The largest of these isles is one narrow island ringed
with a marble wall in the likeness of a ship. Tall, narrow spires rise
from it streaming banners and the grounds are filled with drunken revellers
dancing to the music of a carnival.

#
@dig/tel Ship Island;room_id_436
#
@desc
You have ventured onto an island that bears the appearance of a ship
in full sail. Light streams from tall ivory towers and bathe the
occupants of the courtyard in festive color. Though you seem to be
in the midst of a party, you notice that few venture into the tower
that lies in the east.
#
@dig/tel Tower of Demons;room_id_437
#
@desc
The first thing you notice as you enter the tower is the silence. All
sound from the party outside seems to have been cut off cleanly as
if with a knife. Then you notice the large staircase that dominates
the room. It leads upwards toward a door of ivory that has been
left ajar.

There are no windows and the walls are covered with tapestries
portraying dark and bloody battles dominated by demon forms. There
is writing upon the borders of the tapestries that might contain a
clue as to where you are.
#
@dig/tel Three Legg'd Dog;room_id_438
#
@desc
The interior of the inn is dark, crumbling in some places, but exuding
a certain peacefulness nonetheless. Many of its inhabitants are sprawled
out in front of the roaring fire to shake the damp chill from their bones.

Cots are available for those who wish to rest and heal themselves of
wounds taken in battle..

You are welcome to join them.
#
@dig/tel Haunted Lands;room_id_439
#
@desc
Like the land to the north, this place seems to be absent of color,
existing in a half-way world of black and white. Your sense of
depth-perception seems to be failing you, and strange shadows can be
seen where there are no objects to project them. 

The sun is hidden from the clouds, and a perpetual twilight exists.
Occasionally you see what appear to be walking shades. What substance
these shadows are made of is unknown, for you are fearful to approach
when one happens by.
#
@dig/tel Plain of the Dead;room_id_440
#
@desc
This wide plain was once the site of a battle between the forces of 
darkness and those of light. While the outcome has been obscured by the
passages of time, and the frail memory of Man, this land has been
forever scarred by the forces and tradgedy unleashed here.

Bone fragments still litter the brown grass that fills the plain, and you
smell a rotting scent. A low, squat tower of dark stone sits lonely upon
the plain to the east.
#
@dig/tel Tower of Useth;room_id_441
#
@desc
A tight path leads up into the mountains.  Once blocked, by massive fallen
rock and earth, a recent earthquake opened up the passage.  Since then,
it seems the passage has been frequently traversed.  The sky seems a little
less bright as you ascend the mountain.  Trails of smoke pour forth from 
the valleys.
#
@dig/tel Tomb of Useth;room_id_442
#
@desc
This chamber is octagonal. Each of the walls is plated with a blackened,
rusting iron. If legend is to be believed, the implements of war were
melted down after the battle to create this chamber. 

In the center of the room lies an oblong chunk of a dark crystal. The
crystal is about 6 feet in length, and a couple feet wide. You attempt
to move it, but it refuses to budge. While you watch, a shadow of 
blackness moves across the room, and enters the crystal, turning it a
shade blacker.
#
@dig/tel Weathered Bluff;room_id_443
#
@desc
You stand atop a wind swept bluff which overlooks a deep gorge. The 
bluff is a craggy outcropping, with a sparse covering of grass. Across
the gorge to the west you can see the impressive shapes of the the 
Ebonbane Mountains. You wonder what sights could be seen amongst 
those fabled peaks, but you know of no way to reach them.

A reddish light fills the western sky as the sun sets, a brilliant 
triumph of color and hope amidst a dark and desolate landscape.
#
@dig/tel Ilutian Downs;room_id_444
#
@desc
The landscape here is rocky, and dotted with brown grasses and various
scrub plants. Dark clouds block much of the sun's light, and a strange
twilight exists here. The only color evident in any quantity besides
gray is a dull brown. This is not so much the character of this place,
but rather the influence of the nearby Haunted Lands. To the south,
signs of travel and habitation by humans is visible, but most avoid 
this border with the Haunted Lands.
#
@dig/tel Carolingian Prairie;room_id_445
#
@desc
These wide, green plains are dotted with grazing cattle and livestock,
taken from the city to the south, or from neighboring farmlands.

Compared to the bleakness of the lands to the north, this place is
vivid with color and brightness. 
#
@dig/tel Pool of Blood;room_id_446
#
@desc
This cavern is dominated by a large, sluggish pool. The pool is very 
dark, and looks almost like a tar pit. The color is not black, however,
it is crimson.

The pool is said to be the blood collected from those captured by the 
trolls and sacrificed here. Knowing the barbaric things the trolls are
capable of, and seeing this, you believe that the legends could be true.
#
@dig/tel Troll Warrior Cave;room_id_447
#
@desc
The cave is rather narrow, and low of room. Running down the center of
the chamber is a very deep chasm. The chasm starts at small at the west 
end of the room, but widens to nearly the full width of the chamber at
the east end. It is here that Troll warriors test their courage by
jumping across the chasm, daring others at attempt a more dangerous
one. From the looks of it, a fall into the chasm would surely be fatal.
#
@dig/tel Troll Stair;room_id_448
#
@desc
Large steps lead up into the mountain before you. A stone wall is 
behind you. 

The steps are clearly not of human construction, and are very tall.
The stairway is about 4 feet wide. A small basin lies at the left of
every other step. The basin is filled with a dark liquid which burns
slowly, filling the stairway with a smokey, oily light.
#
@dig/tel Troll King's Tomb;room_id_449
#
@desc
You emerge in a large, domed chamber. In the center of the floor lies
the skeleton of a large humanoid creature, approximately 9 feet tall.
Iron stakes have been driven into the floor around the skeleton. Each 
stake is topped with a partial skeleton, likely human.

Clay pots, which have been sealed with a wax, or possibly fat, have
been arranged in a large pattern. The pots are about 3 feet tall.
Opening one, you are greeted by a horrible stench. The pot contains
partially mummified entrails, and some shattered bones.
#
@dig/tel Crawl-space;room_id_450
#
@desc
You stand hunched over in a narrow tunnel which burrows deeper
into the mountain. The tunnel has been smoothly crafted.

Small, but deep, scratches mar the surface of the tunnel's floor. The
tunnel itself ends in a sudden flat wall. The wall of the dead end
has no apparent edges which might indicate a door or opening. It
does however, bear some faint writing.

This chamber is small, and perfectly round. The surfaces of the chamber
are all made from a marble like stone that possesses a deep blue hue. 
In the center of the room is a pedestal of white stone.

Surrounding the pedestal is a high and wide ring of thorns. As you

This chamber is oval in shape, and has been walled with great timbers

Large stone blocks wall this square chamber, though the ceiling is
far above you and out of sight. Soft snowflakes drift down in a heavy,
but windless, stream. Looking up, you are greeted by a drifting blanket
of white, and a shining brightness. You fail to make out anything beyond
that.

This chamber is largely filled withh a deep drift of snow.
#
@dig/tel Frigid Gallery;room_id_461
#
@desc
You find yourself in a long, chilly hallway of morbid surprises.
Lined alond the walls are tyhe frozen corpses of hapless creatures
of all sorts.

Inspecting one, you find it to be frozen solid, and of iundeterminant
age. A light coating of snow covers the floor of this area, though
its source is unseen. The light coating is soft and appears to have 
lied undisturbed for a long time.
#
@dig/tel White Balcony;room_id_462
#
@desc
You find yourself on a small balcony that overlooks a large cavern
of ice. The cavern extends to the east of you, and reaches far above
and below your current position. The balcony itself seems to be made
of solid ice, and is carved into the wall of this large, white
cavern. 

Dominating the cavern is a gigantic "tree" of ice. The tree reaches
upward from the bottom of the cavern, and extends its icey branches
in all directions as it reaches towards the top of the ice cave.
#
@dig/tel Rime Tree;room_id_463

You hang midway up the trunk of this great frozen tree. Peering
down below you, you can make out the white floor of ice far
below. Above lies thinner branches, and the icicle covered 
cavern ceiling.

To the west of here lies a balcony of ice. It appears as though
you could probably crawl out onto the branches, and jump to it from
there.
#
@dig/tel Hrungnir's Hall;room_id_464

This is a wide circular hall of stone and ice, from which rises the

As you approach the runes, they begin to glow with a dark magic, and

@dig/tel Vafthrudnir's Hall;room_id_465
#
@dig/tel Ice Throne;room_id_466
#
@desc
A long hall stretches out before you, the court of a long forgotten
kingdom in the Ice. At the far end of the chamber can be seen a 
majestic throne carved into the bluish ice that walls this chamber.
Ornate stone work can be glimpsed beneath a thick covering of
translucent ice. 

Large pillars of ice and stone reach up from the floor, twisting 
and spiraling before greeting the ceiling. A heavy, icey mist hangs
low in the air here, and a coldness deeper than anything you have ever
felt reaches into your bones.
#
@dig/tel The Rime Tree;room_id_467
#
@desc
You have reached the very top of this great tree of ice. The cavern
ceiling is almost within reach from here. Far below lies the cavern
floor, obscured in a sea of white.

Directly to the north of you lies a small opening in the cavern face
which was not visible from below. A thick ice branch extends towards it
conveniently.
#
@dig/tel Sand-choked Passage;room_id_468
#
@desc
The walls of this passage have been sculptured somewhat by the winds
which occasionally whistle through the entrance of the pyramid. The 
first 20 feet or so of this passage is filled with sand and small 
pebbles. Fighting your way through this natural barricade, you find
that the passage clears up, and slopes downward slightly.

@dig/tel Purgatory;room_id_470
#
@desc
The universe has regurgitated your putrid life-stuff.

From here, choose a gateway into the land of the living, for the land
of the AfterWards simply cannot tolerate you anymore.

If you are a pitiful HUMAN, you may grab a WEAPON here with which to
defend yourself...lest you return to quickly.

#
@dig/tel Golden Doors;room_id_471
#
@desc
You stand before two humongous gold doors that lead into the wondrous 
lands of fantasy collectively known as the Realm. Before you will be able
to reach the Realm, however, you must first pass a series of simple tests
placed here by the Demon Lord Perimal Darkling, Godling of the Realm.

To overcome these challenges you will have to use the game commands, as 
well as your intellect. If you prove yourself worthy, and reach the Realm,
you will be better prepared to deal with the denizens, both friendly and
hostile, which you will meet. By typing HELP or '?' you will get a listing
of available commands and their usage.
#
@dig/tel Carpeted Concourse;room_id_472
#
@desc
This long hallway beyond the golden doors is lavishly carpeted, and
decorated with trappings of various sorts. Paintings and statues 
line the corridor as if standing in salute of your passage.

An old man can be seen in a small niche in the wall. As you approach
he says to you "I will give you a key to get beyond the door at the
end of this corridor...just because I like you."

[This room is a "shop" type. Type GET to get a listing of all the items
for sale here. The key mentioned is for sale for 0 gold.]

There is a terrible monster hiding here, who will jump out to block
your way if you try to go north. This monster must be killed.

There is a strange man here who offers you a sharpened stick to aid
in your battle.

[If you are a Zombie or a Troll, you possess natural claws. If you are a
human class, you must get a weapon, the sharpened stick in this case,
and then WIELD it. To attack, type ATT followed by the name of the target.
The name can be abbreviated with the fewest unique initials.]
#
@dig/tel Lair of the Beast;room_id_475
#
@desc
This room is the lair of the Beastie, who has gotten a much worse
reputation than he deserves. He is actually quite friendly and
talkative. 

The Beastie sits atop a huge pile of cushions, and is busily devouring
an antelope. He politely stops eating as you enter, and nods in your
direction.

[The Beastie may divulge the password out of this chamber if you
ask him properly by mentioning the correct keyword.] (demonlord)
#
@dig/tel Long Tunnel;room_id_476
#
@desc
You are standing in a long tunnel, which is only dimly lit. You 
follow it along to the east, but it ends in what appears to be 
a dead end. 

Looking down you see a shiny object.

[Hint: pick up the object and examine it.]
#
@dig/tel Street of Ribbons;room_id_477
#

#
@desc
This round chamber is where you must examine your inner being, and
determine is you are ready to enter the world of both beauty and 
violence that lies beyond this small area. The chamber is round, and
free of trappings. there is nothing here which might distract one's
attention away from the necessary introspection. 

[Hint: Check your stats]
#
@dig/tel Gold Alley;room_id_480
#
@desc
This part of the city is quiet and relatively deserted. The buildings
surrounding you proclaim that this was once the location of the Gold
Guild but it has long since been abandoned.
Residents of the city occupy the dark buildings. For some reason, this
is not a popular place to live..
#
@dig/tel Shining court;room_id_481
#
@desc
This area once housed the famed jewelry courts and guilds of gold
and silver. The prosperous guilds have moved their quarters to other
parts of the realm leaving the shining courts empty. Little travel
comes through these quiet streets now.
#
@dig/tel The Rim;room_id_482

You have reached the rim of the city. This is the old wall of inner
defences that once stood against enemy hordes from the east. It has
been abandoned in these more prosperous times.
#
@dig/tel Sun Gate;room_id_483
#
@desc
You stand at the eastern sun gate of Tai-Tastigon. This was once a

The caravan grounds now house the dead..
No one passes through here these days except for the spirits of the
departed.

This chamber is of moderate size, and is oval in shape. A series of
murals runs along the smooth walls, depicting great battles of heroes
long past.

A small gutter runs along the edge of the room, and it is filled with a
burning oil of somesort, which highlights the murals, and fills the
room with a slightly oily scent. In the center of the room, a huge
crescent moon has been carved into the rocky floor.

You stand on a long spiral of wooden steps that lead farther down below
the temple. The sides of the steps are open, and if you are not careful
you could have a nasty fall.
#
@dig/tel Thick Seaweed;room_id_501
#
@desc
You find yourself in a bed of thick seaweed, which floats up around
you obscuring your vision. You feel a slight buoyancy, but are otherwise
none the worse for wear, considering you are meanding around at the
bottom of a lake. The water here is a bit muddy.

The seaweed sways back and forth slightly with the slight current of
the lake, induced by the Wyrmraggen River.
#
@dig/tel Watery Cave;room_id_502
#
@desc
A large cavern, completely filled with water, encloses you as you
wander from the open, if murky, waters to the west into this area.
The cave walls are very irregular, creating a distorting image
when coupled with the natural bending of light rays by the water.
The whole cavern seems to shake gently up and down with the motion
of the currents that can be felt even here, tugging gently at you.

The cavern walls become smoother to the south, where additional chambers
might lay.
#
@dig/tel Aqua Steps;room_id_503
#
@desc
Low, smooth steps spread out before you. The steps are colored a bright
aqua, and seem to radiate a faint glow. The wide stair leads upward
to another chamber.

About halfway up the steps is a shimmering barrier. After taking a few
steps towards it, you finally realize it to be an air pocket of some
sort. Because of the ease with which you have been moving about in 
the magical lake, you have almost forgotten that you were under
water at all.
#
@dig/tel Glistening Columns;room_id_504
#
@desc
This is a most peculiar chamber. It is roughly circular, with walls a
dull color similar to those of the steps which lead up to here. In the
center of the room are several colums which bow and curve noticeably
as they move from a thick base through a slender trunk and again to
a bulky union withh the chamber ceiling above. 

The colums appear to be covered in glistening scales of blue and gold,
which shimmer and twitch as if the scales of a living fish..
#
@dig/tel Room of Shells;room_id_505
#
@desc
This chamber is relatively small compared with the one to the west. The
entire visible surface of the room is covered in a colorful mosaic 
comprised of thousands of tiny shells. 

Staring at the floor and ceiling, you lose yourself in sweeping patterns
of swirls and spirals. The colors seem to appeal to your emotions, and
are very soothing.
#
@dig/tel Coral Doorway;room_id_506
#
@desc
You find yourself at a solid wall of gleaming white coral, intersprersed
with highlights of red. The rock adjacent to the coral wall is dark and
featureless.

Upon examining the coral wall, you notice an almost imperceptable seem
which runs down the center. The shell-like crustaceans you thought were
decorative now appear to cover hinges upon which the large doors of coral
might swing open upon. 
#
@dig/tel Coral Chamber;room_id_507
#
@desc
Compared to the dim tones and lighting of the other chambers of this 
area, this room booms out at you in a brilliant fanfare of gleaming
white coral. You stagger under the initial brightness, but slowly
adjust to it enough in order to peer around.

The chamber is very large, and made entirely of white coral. The room
is bare except for a gigantic shell which rests in the center of the 
chamber. The shell has been subtlely carved into a throne of immense
size.
#
@dig/tel Sinking Passage;room_id_508
#
@desc
The air in this passage is very damp, and the stony floor is covered
with a thin layer of sand. The passage slopes downward noticeably.
#
@dig/tel Whirlpool Bottom;room_id_509
#
@desc
You stand in a round chamber of stone which has no ceiling. Instead,
a gigantic whirlpool of water spins above you, threatening to crush
your pitiful existence. Through some feat of magic, the violent
waters do not reach down into this chamber, held back by an unforseen
force.

The room itself is damp and bare.
#
@dig/tel Elemental Crossroads;room_id_510
#
@desc
You find yourself in a sparsely lit, but well decorated room. All aspects
of the room seem perfectly normal, except for strange murals on each of
the walls. Each wall depicts some form of natural force in action. The 
north wall shows a scene of great winds laying low towering cities. The
east wall depicts a hurricane in the process of flooding out an entire
coastline. The south wall details a scene of thousands of creatures being
totally consumed by a raging fire. Finally, the west wall shows a scene
where great mountain ranges are being pushed up out of the earth's crust.
Also, the murals seem to strangely flicker, as if they were alive. One last
point of interest is a large plaque that has been embedded in the floor.
#
@dig/tel Arlindel's Testimony;room_id_511
#
@desc
This room is very sparsely furnished. In fact, the only furnishing in the
entire room is a solitary table. The table seems to serve as some sort of
display, as on top of the table is a book which has been left open. You
cannot touch the table or the book, however, and each attempt to do so 
results in a stinging sensation in your hand. You also notice that the walls
of the room are covered with murals, or at least, what USED to be murals.
Paint has been splattered on the walls and prevents you from seeing what 
was once there.
#
@dig/tel Hall of Sleet;room_id_512
#
@desc
Immediately upon entering this room, you are hit by an onslaught of sleet!
The sleet comes nearly straight down on you, and upon looking around, you
can find no place to shelter yourself from the freakish weather. When you
look up, you can just barely see the ceiling of the huge hall, but more
than that, you DON'T see any clouds or anything else that might be causing
the downpour of sleet. The sleet seems to materialize from out of nowhere.
#
@dig/tel Frozen Caverns;room_id_513
#
@desc
Upon entering this room, you notice a marked decrease in temperature. Upon
looking around, you don't find that so surprising, as the entire cavern is
covered with ice. The ice seems to be several feet thick except on the floor
where there is just a very thin sheet of ice that is safe enough to walk on.
With the exception of the ice, the cavern is completely empty.
#
@dig/tel Liquid Caverns;room_id_514
#
@desc
This cavern seems to be some sort of aquarium. On either side of you the
walls have been replaced by water, and swimming through the water are various
forms of aquatic life. Upon closer inspection, you discover that there is
nothing preventing the water from flooding the cavern! None the less, the 
water stays in its place, giving you a safe, yet scenic, passage through
the cavern.
#
@dig/tel Boiling Caverns;room_id_515
#
@desc
You find yourself in a completely empty cavern. However, the cavern is not
totally devoid of interest, as it seems as if the very walls of the cavern
were boiling! In fact, one would be hard pressed to come up with a better
description of what you see before you. It is not entirely unlike standing
in the middle of a bubble, with the exception of the solid rock floor that
you are currently standing on. You can now feel the heat coming off of the
boiling walls, but the heat is only strong enough to cause you some slight
discomfort, not any real physical harm.
#
@dig/tel Wystryk Memorial;room_id_516
#
@desc
Upon entering this room, you are immediately stunned by the sheer beauty
of the scene before your eyes. Majestic fountains abound throughout the
whole room, and great sheets of water, like giant waterfalls, fall down
along the entire length and height of the walls. The fountains are magically
lit by some unseen light source, and each has its own color of the rainbow.
The waterfalls are similarly lit, except that the light changes in both
intensity and in its color in a somewhat irregular fashion. Standing all 
alone in the middle of the room is a statue of a man dressed in what seems
to be the robes of a wizard. You can just see that there is some writing
on the base of the statue.
#
@dig/tel Hall of Steam;room_id_517
#
@desc
Upon entering the room, you can't help but notice the sudden increase
in humidity. However, the rise in humidity as not surprising, considering
that the room seems to be filled with steam. While searches for the source
of the steam prove unfruitful, you still determine that the steam is 
replenished somehow, as the steam never dissipates, and the temperature
of the room never drops. It doesn't take long until your clothes are soaked
through, from head to toe. Water (or sweat) streams down your face, as the
steam bath begins to take its full effect on you.
#
@dig/tel Trail of Heat;room_id_518
#
@desc
The walls of this long, but cramped, chamber are made of smooth stones
which glow dimly. The waves of heat they send out suck the air from
your lungs, and crush you under the wieght of your own load. Shimmering
lines of heat are visible here, as moisture is rapidly pulled from your
body. The path through the room appears the safest way through the chamber,
as to move near the walls is to invite damage.
#
@dig/tel Trail of Blazes;room_id_519
#
@desc
Moving along the trail you are greeted here by dancing flames, and
flickering lights. Long shadows are cast oddly against all the walls
as you try and make your way through past the unbearable heat.

Sweat trickles down your brow, and you are near unconsciousness...
#
@dig/tel Trail of Cinders;room_id_520
#
@desc
The darkened chamber is lit by the dim glow from hot cinders which
line the single path through the room. The smell of fire and smoke
reaches your nostrils as you survey your surroundings. Occassionally
a burnign ember drifts up on a slight breeze and floats across your
path, but if you stay on the trail you should remain free of injury.
#
@dig/tel Tomb of Fastigonn;room_id_521
#
@desc
This stately chamber apparently houses the remains of a personage of
some importance. Narrow columns run up the walls, supporting a ceiling
that is detailed with a picture of a great city basking in brilliant
sunlight. At the center of the chamber is a narrow, but very tall
sarcophagus of black stone. Placed atop this strange item is a disk
of gleaming brass. Some words can be seen on the black stone.
#
@dig/tel Hall of Smoke;room_id_522
#
@desc
Thick, acrid smoke fills this room. At first you try to bend low beneath
it, but this smoke clings tightly to the floor, smothering you in its
weight. At length you notice a narrow passage through the haze towards
the far exit. It seems to be the sole escape from the choking morass
which clogs your lungs.
#
@dig/tel Magma Path;room_id_523
#
@desc
Suddenly, you find yourself in the middle of an immense lava flow! You cannot
see any end to the molten rock, as the flow spreads out to the horizons.
Strangly, however, the lava seems to totally avoid the narrow path which you
are on. So, for the meantime, you are presently safe. There seems to be no
source of the magma flow, as there is not one volcano in sight. However, the
flow shows no sign of ceasing.
#
@dig/tel Earthen Path;room_id_524
#
@desc
It is hard to concentrate on anything in this "room" as everthing in it is
in constant motion. It is equally difficult to descibe what you see before
you except maybe by the phrase, "Standing in the middle of an avalanche",
only because that is exactly what it seems like. There is falling rock
everywhere, except for a small path through the middle of all the chaos,
which the rocks seem to magically avoid. It is impossible to determine
where the rocks are coming from, nor can you see where they are going.
All you can tell is that the rocks don't seem to be piling up anywhere.
Also, with the exception of the path, there is no evidence of a floor
anywhere, nor is there any ceiling or walls.
#
@dig/tel Desert Path;room_id_525
#
@desc
Suddenly, you find yourself standing in the middle of a desert! Sand swirls
around in large sand storms, and sand dunes can be seen for miles! However,
it doesn't seem to be too hot, as one would expect with any desert. You also
notice a small path through the middle of all the sand. It is devoid of any
trace of the desert around it and seems very safe. You currently find 
yourself in the middle of the path and thanks the Gods for it, as the sand
storms just off of the path seem pretty nasty.
#
@dig/tel Shrine of Exomerol;room_id_526
#
@desc
This room has nothing in it whatsoever, just a dirt floor and walls which
were carved right out of the rock. However the walls are covered from
floor to ceiling with murals of some sort. They seem to have been painted
directly on the rough, rocky walls. Upon further inspection of the room,
you also discover a small bronze plate embedded in the west wall. It appears
to have something inscribed on it.
#
@dig/tel Hall of Dust;room_id_527
#
@desc
You find yourself standing in a grand hall, the likes of something one would
see in a royal palace, but seems somewhat out of its proper place in its
current environment. The one odd thing about this whole hall is that
everything is covered by a one-inch layer of dust. The dust even seems to
hang suspended in the air, making breathing a little uncomfortable.
#
@dig/tel Corridor of Smog;room_id_528
#
@desc
Heavy, damp smog hangs thick in this chamber, obscuring your vision,
and making breathing difficult. Through the dark haze you can
see the murals on the wall, which depict sprawling cities. You cannot
tell wether the clouds that hang low over the cities are an element
of the mural, or rather just an influence of the gases residing in
this chamber itself.
#
@dig/tel Corridor of Wind;room_id_529
#
@desc
Strong winds buffet you as you attempt to work yourway through this
chamber. A faint path is inscribed on the stone floor, leading
towards the opposite exit. Beyond the path the winds seem stronger.

The walls here are deep grey in color, though all attempts at
decoration seem to have been worn off by the unusual winds that
move through here.
#
@dig/tel Corridor of Storms;room_id_530
#
@desc
The walls of the corridor you now find yourself in perspire with
moisture, as the air here is exceedingly damp. A brisk breeze
whistles through the hallway, ruffling your clothes.

Crude murals adorn the walls, damaged by the moisture. They depict
violent storms ravaging a small village.

The breeze is stronger to the west.

@dig/tel Sloping Hillside;room_id_543
#

Lose rocks are all along this passage.  The top of the Mountian is within
sight.  From here you can see all along the forest.  The entrance to the city
of Tia-Tastigon is also visible form here.  The large rock are black and
easily broken apart, as it appears some force already crushed the rocks.
The hillside is steep enough to slow acsent, which is possible only because
of the well worn path up the hill.
#

Two doors of solid stone block the passageway here. The doors are

#
@dig/tel Granite Stair;room_id_545

This circular chamber has been lovingly carved out of the surrounding
granite. Wide steps lead upward, carved with images of dragons and
battles. The steps are short, apparently made for those of smaller
stature than Men.

#
@dig/tel Onyx Dome;room_id_546

onyx, infused with veins of gold. The dome is richly carved to
depict beings of a supernatural nature.

#
@dig/tel Silver Anvil;room_id_547
#
@desc
This chamber is a large natural cavern that has been slightly worked
by Dwarven hands. Large veins of silver streak across the ceiling,
and similar spidery threads adorn the walls and floor. In the center
of the room, a large silver anvil stands alone. It has been richly
carved, and seems more symbolic than functional.

#
@dig/tel Eldren Spyre;room_id_548
#

You stand in a columned hall that is the base for the whispy tower

Spidery steps lead upwards along the towers walls.
#
@dig/tel Cavern Beyond Time;room_id_549
#
@desc
Strange forces tug at you as you stand is this quiet cavern of ice.
The walls of the cavern are sheer sheets of ice, in which images seem
to move. Visions of ages past are reflected back at you as you feel the
ebb of the tides of time. Tenatively, you touch the walls...they are solid.

You stand a stranger in a place where time has little meaning, alone
with the weight of the past bearing down upon you.

In the center of the cavern is a low pedestal.
#
@dig/tel Whirlpool;room_id_550
#
@desc
You are suspended in a small pocket of still air at the center of a
vast whirpool of water. You can sense a light source from somewhere
above, but can discern very little otherwise. The water swirls about
you at an incredible rate, churning the brilliant blue water into
white foam near the center of the whirpool.

Far below you is a small haven of solid ground.

A sunless sky burns brightly down upon you. Though you can see no fiery orb
through the thick haze above you, you can feel its immense heat. You feel as 
though you are deep underground, and this does not conflict with what you

light and heat emanate from.

Trackless wastes, and shifting sand dunes lie all about you, disturbed by

@dig/tel Walls of Water;room_id_556
#
@desc
You find yourself before an awesome, if mind-boggling sight. To the south
rises a towering wall of water, which stretches east and west as far as
you can see. No barriers serve to hold the water up...it stands immobile
as if of its own accord, forming the gigantic wall before you.

As you turn around to survey your position, you are greeted by another
stunning occurance. All around you the shifting sands of the desert 
retreat before you as if blown by ferocious winds. They leave behind
a chasm of immense breadth and depth. You are trapped now before the
walls of water and the infinite chasm...

You find yourself in a rocky enclave which acts as shelter from the
immense harshness of the desert. To the north and south rise
stony hills which act as breakwalls to protect this place from the
continuous waves of sand which seeek to overwhelm and bury it.

To the east, a ramp rises up the face of a partially buried pyramid,
terminating at a dark point about half way up.

This dark path weaves its way amongst the mountainsides. The path

You stand at the top of a steep path that leads up from the lowlands
into the foothills of the Ebonbane Mountains. From this vantage you
can see the white expanse of the northern lowlands spread out before
you. To the south, on the other hand, lie the darker peaks of the
mountains. This spot in particular is marked with a stone cairn of
some fallen warrior, and indicates the beginning of the Path of Shadows.
#
@dig/tel Realm of Dark Dreams;room_id_561

Darkness surrounds you as you stand before a single silvery path of
light that leads off into the distance. You can feel that this place
has its own dark inhabitants, and that they do not approve of
visitors. It is here to which the Tuatha de Danaan have retreated
from mankind, and where they live in dark solitude.

The silver strand of light leads north from this place, towards a
faraway fire. You find that by mere thought you can move yourself
through this dark landscape.
#
@dig/tel Fire in the Dark;room_id_562

A great fire burns here, in the darkness. It sheds light, but little
warmth upon the cold void of dreams. You are drawn towards the
flame by a sudden desire, drawn by a faint wavering sound that is
almost, but not quite, human.

You now recognize that this place is an abode of Lugh. Looking inside
the flame you can see the wavering image of the object of your desire.
All you need do is reach out and take it...

This chamber is the shape of a pentegram, and is of dark, but not black,
stone. The roof is low, but slopes into a slight dome in the center.
At the center of the chamber is a bronze brazier in which burns a pale
flame. In the center of the flame you can see a thin ring of metal.

A faint mist clings to the walls here, moving slightly as if animated,
but never leaving the surface of the rock. It watches, and waits...

No sounds can be heard here, it is quiet; as quiet as death itself.

It differs, however, in its shape. This chamber is long and rectangular.

In the center of the chamber lies a rectangular pool of molten metal. A
frigid mist rises off the pool, dancing and swirling before you. As you
approach, the form of a sword slowly forms in the liquid metal...

This room is an circular hall, floored in the same milky marble seen

brilliant fire the runes that they touch.

This small, smoky chamber is lined with iron racks that hold various
odd shaped instruments. Some are delicate and finely crafted, while

the various unspeakable ceremonies that take place in this tower.
A wizened old crone, face always hidden by a thick, hooded robe, minds
the equipment here with a casual air.

A tight path leads up into the mountains.  Once blocked, by massive fallen

A once great keep lies humbled by the ravages of time before you.
The stones that formed its inpenetrable walls and battlements lay
strewn about the ground here as if pebbles tossed into the wind.
The great gateway has been thrown down, and all that remains of the
proud walls are several very long stones that alone have resisted the
efforts of wind, weather and time. 

All in all, not much remains here to give testiment to the past. Some
low walls and scattered stones are all that remain here.

@dig/tel Cobbled Courtyard;room_id_614

A cobbled courtyard surrounds you, as you stand in the center of the
ruins of this keep. The stones have been worn smooth by countless
years and countless feet. The outlines of many buildings radiate 
out from this courtyard, but nothing much is left. The walls that
remain are no more than knee height, and most have crumbled to just
an impression on the ground.

To the north is the outline of a large rectangular building, while
to the east is the best preserved structure of the ruins, the base of
a small tower.

This place was once a chapel of somesort, from the looks of it. The
outline of the building is large and rectangular. The floor of the

The one peculiar aspect of this area lies in the center of the
floor, where a ten foor by ten foot iron plate has been set into
the ground, with thick nobs sticking out at each corner. Upon the
plate is the large outline of a hand, underneath which is a triangle.

You find yourself at a set of sandstone steps in the center of a

as if they have been untouched or seen by Man for eons. They lead
into the darkness below.
#
@dig/tel Temple of Anubis;room_id_672
#
@desc
This chamber is circular, and has a very high ceiling. In the center of
the room is a 12 foot tall statue of the jackle-headed god Anubis. As
a result of some complicated and unseen feat of optics and construction,
a single ray of light shines down upon the statue from above, its
origin unseen. 

It is likely that the builders of this pyramid might have made 
offerings to Anubis in this place in return for his protection of the
souls interred in this great pyramid.
#
@dig/tel Treasure of Krotche;room_id_673
#
@desc
This chamber is triangular in shape, and is bare of any furnishings. Some
simple hieroglyphics adorn the walls, and probably serve as a 
proclamation of whose chamber this is. 

The stone and construction of this chamber differs from that of the
rest of the pyramid, being smoother and more defined. You again wonder
about the strange portal and try to determine where you *really* are.
It occurs to you that other portals like the first might exist in this
chamber, but lie unseen to your human eyes.
#
@dig/tel Ocean's Tunnel;room_id_674
#
@desc
You stand in an odd tunnel which has been burrowed through the mass of the
Ocean itself. An unimaginable weight of water lies above you, and yet is
held back by some unforseen force. The floor of the tunnel is the 
sandy floor of the Ocean, which is now as dry and parched as the desert 
you have just left. 
#
@dig/tel Behind the Mirror;room_id_675
#
@desc
You have entered a shadowy Realm where the bounds of normal reality do
not necessarily hold. Nothing here is of solid form, only vague shadows
which shift in shade and form, moving from angular black to amorpheous
gray. You sense the presence of other beings here as you float in
uncertainty, and attempt to regain your balance and consciousness.
#
@dig/tel Ghalstract Absolung;room_id_676
#
@desc
The place you are now in defies logical explanation. All around you an
infinite plain of black marble stretches with perfect flatness. In a 
blink of an eye it suddenly becomes a molten sea of boiling lava. In
another blink, the lava becomes a broth of blood and dismembered corpses,
only to revert again to the black plain.

Above you you sense a presence...an entity of great malicious power that
does not present itself to be seen...only felt. 
#
@dig/tel Hall of Pillars;room_id_677
#
@desc
Huge pillars extend upward from the floor of this chamber into the
dark innards of the pyramid. Almost no light reaches this place from
the outside. Instead, lighting is provided from several oil lamps
which burn mysteriously...and have apparently done so for a great
many years.

At the end of the hall, some steps lead down.
#
@dig/tel Ocean's Tunnel;room_id_678

The wieght of the Ocean lies above you, but is prevented from crushing

#
@dig/tel Towering Gates;room_id_679
#
@desc
The magical tunnel ends at this point, where an equally impressive 
wall of stone rises up to meet the Ocean. The wall if constructed of
huge blocks of dark stone, and provides the first physical barrier
to the advance of the sea.

Set into this huge wall at the point where the tunnel encounters it is
a doorway. The door is as high as the tunnel, and looks very solid. The
stonework in which the door is set has been delicately carved, and some
words have been inscribed there.
#
@dig/tel Bottom Hall;room_id_680
#
@desc
This is a narrow, but immensely long chamber. A fine carpet stretches
out before you, flanked periodically by armored figures. The figures 
shortly reveal themselves to be nothing more than empty suits of 
armor, affixed here for display.

The hall is otherwise empty. 
#
@dig/tel Ivory Steps;room_id_681

@desc
This stairway spirals steeply upward, leading you deeper into the
unknown. The steps appear to be made of some form of ivory or bone,
each step carved from a gigantic tusk or bone. Seeing the steps 
extend numeriously before and behind you, you shudder to think what
beast might yield such treasures.
#

@dig/tel Trial of Fire;room_id_683
#

You stand in a long, narrow corridor. Spouts of flame erupt from 
carefully prepared holes in the floor and walls of the corridor, 
scorching you with every burst. At the far end of the corridor is 
a closed door. 

At this point you begin to have second thoughts and turn to retreat,
but the door has closed behind you!

As you begin to ascend the sloping passage, an iron panel slides down
from its hiding place to block off the entrance to this passage. Up ahead
you can see another doorway, but the sloping passage is covered with ice,
making progress unsteady.

You now begin to feel the incredible bite of the cold here, as you
feel completely trapped in this malicious freezer. You realize that you
will freeze to death if you do not escape quickly.
#
@dig/tel Guardian's Chamber;room_id_687
#
@desc
This chamber is circular, and exhibits as its lone decorations several
weapon racks. An oil lamp hangs from the ceiling, and swings slightly
to a hidden breeze. The guardian of this chamber will stand underneath
the lamp, awaiting the next challenge, and his next foes.
#
@dig/tel Central Chamber;room_id_688
#
@desc
This room is octagonal in shape, but the floor curves gradually up to
meet the walls in such a fashion that it almost appears spherical. The
ceiling is domed, but not very high. The floor appears to be of a
single slab of stone. A thin vein of gold runs through this slab, starting
at the walls and spiralling gradually inward in a way that is too
concentric to be natural.

In the center of the chamber is a huge stone table, which is round in
shape. The table bears no discernable markings. There are no further
furnishings or decorations.
#
@dig/tel Central Steps;room_id_689
#
@desc
You now stand on wide steps of stone that gradually spiral their way
up farther into unknown territory. The walls are of thick, dry stone,
and you have no way of knowing if you are underground or inside a
massive castle.

The air here is dry, and has a faintly sweet smell to it.
#
@dig/tel Misty Isle;room_id_690
#
@desc
The steps from below emerge onto the mist-shrouded surface of a
rocky isle. The ground immediately surrounding you is covered with
jutting pieces of rock, and the smell of the Sea hangs thickly in the
air. The fog is very thick, preventing you from seing more than a few
feet in front of you. You can, however, discern that the Sea is
very close to the north, while the rocky terrain becomes more
difficult to traverse in other directions.
#
@dig/tel Misty Seas;room_id_691
#
@desc
The water is perfectly calm all around you, with only a hint of breeze. The
gentle lapping of the water is the only sound to reach you from the

their own accord.

The wind seems stronger to the north.
#
@dig/tel Arthur's Tomb;room_id_692
#

This large, rectangular chamber is dominated by what appears to be
a rough hewn block of ice. The ice is very clear, but very dry and
only slightly cool to the touch. The giant block rests upon a block
of black marble, which is in turn set into a cobbled floor.

Inside the strange block of ice can be seen a stately warrior, dressed
in full armor and bearing a dragon upon his shield. The warrior
has no visible wounds, and appears to be merely resting peacefully.

Recent fires have raged through here, destroying every living thing.  A few
sprouts of weeds and grass can be seen springing up to bring new life into
these hills.  The ground is still pretty hot, the fire must have been very
recent.  Rocks crumble on the slightest pressure from ones foot, from the
immense heat raging once through the land.

Seeing that the chared remains of animals and trees are darker here, one can
presume that this is probably where the great fire started.  Certain death
would become anyone who was in the at the time of the fire.  Ashes still float
in the air, making it difficult to both see and breathe.  Of what you can
smell, is of charred flesh and hair from once living creatures of a great
forest.

north door to the edges of the semi-circle.

The room you stand in is lit by some unknown source. A large circle of black
stone faces upright in the middle of the room, a ring of elder glyphs cut
into the stone around an avellan cross. Thongs possibly designed to tie
wrists and ankles are situated at likely spots on the disk of black marble.
Opposite the stone altar is a black circular mirror, reflecting what little
light there is in this room.

Misty tendrils stream down from the circle of black glass high above like
spiderwebs, seeming to undulate into and out of the black mirror. Something
seems to move inside the writhing mass of darkness.
#
@dig/tel Tower of Yslsl;room_id_720

You stand in the lower hall of a solid, circular tower. It rises up
almost a hundred feet, and you can scale the heights from the inside
by following the stone steps which wind about its circumference.
The tower has no windows, aperatures, or other adornments upon its
smooth features, and has been constructed of giant blocks of stone
which appear immune to the effects of time.

#

the tower.

This chamber contains an immense wooden throne which appears to have
been sculpted from the ancient, gnarled tree which is behind it. The

above the throne. A few marble pillars stand silently, as if in
testament to the timeless majesty that this chamber embodies.

as well as your own thoughts and beliefs. Obviously this is a very
magical item.

This area is more brightly illuminated than the rest of the tower,
and is dominated by a stunning mural of of an autumn sunset as
seen through the colored leaves of a stand of trees. The floor here

yellow, and brown are trapped or frozen just under the surface
of the stone.
